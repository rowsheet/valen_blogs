{"the-intensifying-impacts-of-the-innovation-economy": {"content": "\nThe influence data and technology have had on the industries that leverage them is undeniable. However, some insurers still believe \u2014 even in 2019 \u2014 that their industry is somehow insulated from those effects. Unfortunately, those who still hold onto those beliefs will likely find themselves facing some hard truths.\nTechnology and the innovation economy will\u00a0have an increasingly significant impact\u00a0on\u00a0the way insurance is handled, and those who embrace a data-driven future will be the ones leading the pack. In the coming year (and beyond), insurers will be pressed to answer a variety of questions unique to the digital age, the most pertinent of which may be these three:\n\u2022 How will work be defined when the nature of employment is rapidly changing?\n\u2022\u00a0What\u2019s the right way to cover people with income that comes from several sources that change on a daily basis?\n\u2022\u00a0How should insurance handle the shift away from traditional ownership?\nTechnology and data will influence the way all three of these questions are answered in one way or another. By embracing each, insurers can open themselves up to more innovative ways to serve and cover their customers.\nInsuring Modern Economies\nRecent innovations haven\u2019t just transformed existing economies. They\u2019ve created brand new ones, all of which already affect the insurance industry in some fashion. Here are two of the biggest.\nAutomation:\u00a0The automation economy will have arguably the biggest impact on the insurance industry because its effects will be wide-ranging.\u00a0A McKinsey study\u00a0found that half of existing workplace responsibilities can be automated, meaning that the ripple effect of automation has only just begun.\nAutomation can also be used directly within the industry to improve administrative efficiency and overall accuracy. Amazon has already embraced machine learning, using it to modernize its warehouse. And while automation can be a boost to workplace efficiency, it\u2019ll also drastically change the nature of risk in the workplace.\nFurthermore, automation could expand the scope of auto insurance and worker\u2019s compensation, though what that ultimately looks like is unknown right now. When it comes to the automation economy, nothing is free from its impact.\nAccess: It won\u2019t be long before the sharing and subscription services usurp traditional notions of ownership. Companies like Spotify and Netflix have already changed how we access music and movies, but we\u2019re also starting to see other attitudes about ownership change.\nNeed proof? Just look at auto and home ownership. In auto\u2019s case, a Lyft study found that 250,000 of its customers got rid of their cars in 2017 in favor of ride-share services. As for homeownership, U.S. Census data reports that those numbers declined in 90 percent of U.S. cities from 2000 to 2015. Each statistic illustrates that ownership isn\u2019t as alluring, or attainable, to American consumers as it once was.\nThe access economy is also challenging the definition of work. According to Gallup,\u00a057 million Americans\u00a0draw some form of income from the gig economy. The continued rise of independent contracting means how those businesses cover those employees will need to change as well.\nInsurers need to adapt to these changing definitions and economies or face the risk of being outpaced by the competition. The best way to do this is to embrace innovative economies to assess risk and process claims. Just as data and technology drive these new economies, they will also fuel the insurance industry \u2014 and those who fail to get on board will soon find themselves left in the dust.\nNever miss the latest news.

In the digital era we live in, there\u2019s another resource whose value is similarly unquestioned: data.\nIn the same way oil fuels our cars and homes, data is the catalyst behind the next generation of innovative solutions like AI and blockchain. Consequently,\u00a0some industries and companies have already recognized data\u2019s current and continuing value. Intel, for example, now\u00a0leverages data\u00a0to find new ways to grow its business in the wake of declining PC sales.\u00a0However, data\u2019s worth isn\u2019t exclusive to the tech sector. Other industries \u2014 namely insurance \u2014 also stand to benefit from the myriad innovative solutions data brings to the table.\nAdopting data-driven strategies has the potential to revolutionize insurance, providing paths to greater operational efficiency, better claims processing, and more precise risk appraisal. Going forward, those that can harness data\u2019s power to fuel every aspect of business can have a leg up on their competition, while those who stick to older methods will quickly find themselves on running on fumes.\nHow Data Consortiums Can Fuel Insurers\nWith data\u2019s importance to the future of insurance already well-established, how can insurers effectively incorporate it into their respective workflows? Traditionally, underwriting and rating decisions utilize aggregated datasets that identify trends, yet don\u2019t offer micro-level information that can support real-time decision making.\nPrimary data sources, on the other hand, help paint a clearer picture of customer behavior. It\u2019s why many companies that rely on these large datasets look for transactional and behavioral data to supplement the information they already have. Thankfully, primary sources are more readily available than they used to be, meaning insurers should theoretically be reaping the benefits of more granular data.\nHowever, a Valen Analytics study discovered that 60 percent of insurers already deal with lengthy production backlogs and difficulty finding analytics talent, proof that data offers new and unique efficiency challenges that most insurers aren\u2019t ready to tackle. For one, the sheer volume of sources makes picking the optimal repository a daunting task; additionally, sifting through these numerous sources can exhaust an already overextended Analytics department.\nThese issues \u2014 and others \u2014 cause headaches that many insurers are ill-equipped to deal with, leading many to stick to the old, manual way of doing things. This is where data consortiums come in to be the jolt an operation needs.\nMake Your Insurance Operation Go\nConsortiums have long existed in other industries and are gaining traction in P/C to manage and assess large pools of shared data,\u00a0 then offer this information to insurance companies. This takes the administrative and IT burden off insurers\u2019 shoulders, while still providing all the requisite value.\nInsurance companies don\u2019t necessarily have to be data barons to reap the benefits of more accurate claims and better underwriting. To take advantage of the fuel that will drive the insurance industry in the future, insurers should look into what a data consortiums could do for them.\nData is the here and now for forward-thinking insurance companies.

But it wasn\u2019t until the 21st century that its full potential was discovered and realized. With the right tools, savvy insurers can use data and analytics to guide their strategies in order to amplify the customer experience and identify growth opportunities.\nWhile data\u2019s value is obvious to nearly all insurers, what\u2019s less obvious is how to actually leverage the insights from their data. As Harvard economics professor Sendhil Mullainathan has said,\n\n\u201cThe problem with data is that it says a lot, but it also says nothing. To understand why something is happening, we have to engage in both forensics and guesswork.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe presence of a data set doesn\u2019t instantly provide insurers with a course of action to take.\nData Barriers Insurers Must Overcome\nToday\u2019s sophisticated analytics can at times feel like a code that constantly needs to be cracked. To realize data\u2019s true potential, insurers need to find ways to bypass those blockages. These are three common obstacles many insurers will encounter in their mission to pull actionable insights from data:\n1. Lack of qualified analysts\nAnalytics isn\u2019t a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d proposition. It requires skilled humans to contextualize information in order to properly apply it, which presents a problem because the talent needed for this sort of job is in short supply.\nIn fact, a recent Valen Analytics survey concluded that 75 percent of insurers struggle to attract the talent needed to manage predictive models.\nThe issue is that analytics and insurance experts don\u2019t see where their specialties merge. Without qualified data analysts there to translate, it\u2019s easy for insurers to become overwhelmed by a sea of data and incapable of comprehending it.\n2. Trouble with legacy data\nA swarm of incoming external data can be overwhelming enough, but an even bigger hurdle comes when insurers try to integrate legacy information. This data on past experience is an essential part of creating a predictive model, but when it comes from an array of sources, it tends to bring a variety of complications.\nSome figures may be incomplete, while others may be redundant or actively contradict one another. For smaller insurance companies, sifting through this clutter of data and turning it into something useful can seem like an insurmountable task.\n3. Making data actionable\nEven the most sophisticated and accurate models\u00a0can be difficult to translate into decision support in the real world. The connections between raw information and practical application are rarely obvious to the untrained eye. Data has the potential to be both a preemptive tool and a resource after the fact, so it\u2019s important to know what you want from data and how to get it.\nThese are some of the more common challenges that prevent insurers from fully embracing analytics. But even in their absences, an effective implementation requires a measured approach and a clear strategy.\nAs the insurance industry matures, its data use must also mature in order to bring more value to the customer. However, antiquated systems supporting new technology leave these insurers floundering and wondering how to act next.\nValen Analytics can help insurers take the next step into this brave new world without crumbling under the weight.

He added that by the time the 21st century ends, the progress would feel like 20,000 years\u2019 worth of transition instead of 100.\nAt the time, Kurzweil\u2019s statement sounded a bit dubious. But with how rapidly technology has transformed over the last two decades, it now seems that the world\u2019s ability to change quickly was drastically underestimated.\nThe fact is that we live in an age defined by acceleration, and this incredible pace of change has exceeded many industries\u2019 capacity to handle it. Changes that once took an entire generation for people to adapt to now take 10 years. The possibilities of this rapidly changing landscape are endless and so, of course, is the risk that comes with it.\nThe Far Reaches of Risk\nIt should come as no surprise that as technology rapidly transforms, risk shifts along with it. Advancement is a double-edged sword. It can simultaneously create a greater level of safety for the status quo and change the very nature of risk, forcing insurers to build new coverage solutions to address previously unforeseen concerns.\nFor instance, autonomous vehicles might be safer drivers than humans, but they\u2019re also vulnerable to cyberattacks and malware. In many cases, driverless cars (and rapidly changing tech like them) blur the lines of where risk even falls. For proof, just take a look at the sharing economy. It\u2019s less than a decade old, yet it\u2019s raised major questions in terms of how coverage works. If, for example, you drive for Uber or Lyft, is your car classified as a work vehicle or a personal one? And does the coverage shift throughout the day as drivers turn their ride-sharing service on and off? Insurance companies have to find answers for these types of problems on a daily basis.\nIt\u2019s an understandably complex and \u2014 for many insurance leaders \u2014 intimidating concept. However, while progress may be rapid, it\u2019s not entirely unpredictable. For insurers, the future has the potential to be bright for those who remain engaged with the changing landscape of risk. Here\u2019s what those leaders can expect:\n1. Humans will gain a deeper understanding of risk.\nWhile technology\u2019s race toward the future provides ample opportunity for confusion, it also provides the tools to parse through that confusion and come to a better understanding of risk. Telematics, machine learning, data analytics, and more all give insurers much greater insight into how risk touches every aspect of life.\nCommercial auto insurers are dipping their toes into telematics to explore how they can be applied to evaluate individual driving behaviors. Companies can examine individual driving habits to see how those routines inform the kinds of services and discounts they can offer customers. Instances like these are only going to become more common. This type of granular data sharing will have a direct impact on how coverage is constructed and provided in the future.\n2. The way humans and technology relate to risk will change.\nAs automation continues to be integrated into daily life, coverage will have to properly account for and balance the effect computers and humans each have on rates.\nAmazon has more than 100,000 automated and robotic systems integrated into its operations working with human employees to maintain efficiency. The online retailer has almost certainly had to consider how to provide coverage to cover its employees while they work in tandem with heavy machinery, something companies in similar situations will also have to consider.\nRegulation for this, as you can imagine, is still being crafted. Insurers will need to make sure they continue to stay up-to-date on how and when machines can take over from humans and how that will affect risk.\n3. Customer service will look a little different.\nThanks to the Internet of Things, insurers will be able to learn about incidents in real time and process claims before a policyholder even gets involved. These instantaneous notifications are clearly useful for insurance companies, but, used correctly, they can also be a major selling point for consumers.\nMachine learning could have a similar impact on customer service. It can be used to pinpoint a highly customized plan for every individual without the customer having to do most of the groundwork.\nThis age of acceleration is intimidating, and it certainly shows no signs of slowing down. Leadership, however, should look at all this innovation as an opportunity, not a threat. Insurers can leverage tech to improve the customer experience from quote to claim, and as technology advances, so will the tools that help insurers understand risk.\nThere\u2019s no denying that infrastructure, demographics, and risk are all changing at breakneck speeds. To keep up, insurers must not just follow change \u2014 they need to grab it by its horns and embrace the new before it becomes old hat.\nAre you in need of more guidance on how to prepare for the changing landscape of risk?

No matter the case being handled, insurers never know everything about the risk they\u2019re writing and are often at the mercy of information that, like a game of Telephone, flows from the policyholder to the agent and then, finally, to the insurer.\nEven insurers that build in-house models can fall victim to the limitations of their data. That\u2019s especially true if the insurer isn\u2019t a massive company or is unable to leverage a consortium to flesh out a data set. A consortium \u2014 like the one we offer at Valen Analytics \u2014 provides a wealth of detailed transactional data that can fill in information gaps insurers might have and prevent them from making capital mistakes of their own.\nLet the Numbers Even the Odds\nThe potential a more robust data set has to even out the balance of power between insurers and policyholders isn\u2019t some pie-in-the-sky theory. The success insurers have had leveraging Valen\u2019s data consortium to support their analytics programs show that it\u2019s an investment worth making. Here are a few reasons a program built on data with greater breadth and depth can be such an asset to an insurer:\n\nIt more accurately matches risk to price. \n\nWhen properly built and utilized, advanced data analytics help ensure that policyholders are correctly charged for the risk they present. Underwriter and agent influences combine with data science to reach a more nuanced decision.\nMetromile, for example, has instituted a pay-per-mile business model to provide customers with more affordable car insurance rates. The insurer uses data to calculate how much risk a driver poses and informs agents and underwriters. The approach not only implements transparency into pricing, but it also provides a more customer-friendly insurance experience.\nSlice Labs used a similar concept to turn data-driven pricing into an entirely new business model. The outfit provides insurance for the Airbnb set. Hosts pay for only the length of time a guest is staying to receive coverage for things like property damage, high energy costs, and infestation.\n\u00a0\n\n It can help identify fraud.\n\nGetting rid of fraud benefits everyone, but regularly auditing every single policy on the books is simply unrealistic. While there are common methods to catch major instances of premium fraud, many smaller but still harmful incidents go unseen.\nHowever, fraud analytics powered by a robust data set can perform checks and raise red flags much more efficiently than humans can, which can have a huge impact on a company\u2019s bottom line. Extensive data sets can also be used to improve customer experience, specifically when it comes to identifying patterns of fraud and areas where fast claim processing can boost a customer\u2019s satisfaction rating.\nInsurers can use the existing data collected by consortiums to pinpoint those trends and reduce the need for additional questions and scrutiny when the policyholder is already in a vulnerable position. All these data points can be used to resolve claims fraud in an efficient, convenient, and clear manner.\n\u00a0\n\n It can triage claims more quickly accurately.\n\nData analytics can be a boon to claims adjusters, ensuring they don\u2019t overlook something important while reducing cycle times by as much as 15 percent, according to a LexisNexis study. They help adjusters more effectively triage claims and use more customized experiences to significantly improve claimant outcomes and get them back to full health faster.\nAn enhanced data science outlook can provide adjusters with a clearer picture of whether a specific claim could lead to large losses. In the long run, data analytics can ultimately be a cost-saving measure that allows insurers to anticipate risk and control claim costs.\nInsurance has a reputation as a necessary evil. According to research by Ernst & Young, 57 percent of consumers are unhappy with their insurance. People use it only during times of pain and, even then, are reluctant to submit a claim for fear that their rates will increase. As insurers become more data-driven, increased fairness and transparency can change that perception.\n\u00a0\nWith data analytics, insurers can become better acquainted with their customers and use that knowledge to provide high-quality, relevant, and cost-effective services. Capital mistakes are ill-affordable for insurers or policyholders.

The management team was bullish on growth in workers\u2019 compensation, and they often had to contend with a known analytical competitor. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have the data required to build a predictive model that would enable profitable growth into new states, and he couldn\u2019t take the risk of suffering the new business penalty with high loss ratios. And finally, there\u2019s Bill. Bill had an expense problem, a growing concern of many insurers, and needed to focus his limited underwriting resources on policies requiring their attention. Straight-through processing driven by analytics was the only way to achieve lower costs without negatively impacting profitability.\nWe hear these stories often. As you read the results of our third annual ROI study, the most important takeaway is that starting with a specific business objective is the only way to achieve market leading results like what we\u2019re reporting below.\nROI Study Results\nValen customers are bucking the trend and continue to grab market share, demonstrating the undeniable value of applied analytics. In the third year of our annual ROI study, the results once again show our customers are able to outperform the market and grow at almost 3x the industry average.\nHere\u2019s what we learned.\nInsurers with profitability issues reduced loss ratio 35 points,\nand continue to beat the market\n\nFor the subset of customers with profitability problems (primarily with a loss ratio greater than 60), the results are swift and significant. Collectively, the group improved loss ratio by 21 points within the first year. It\u2019s also worth noting that the advantage of predictive analytics did not end when the immediate danger went away. With data-driven decision-making now integrated into their underwriting workflows, these same carriers continued to remain profitable. As a result, this group of Valen customers outperformed the market, experiencing loss ratio improvement of 32 points when compared to the rest of the industry at 17.9. That\u2019s roughly 1.9X better.\nValen customers outperform the market every year since 2012\n\nInsurers evolve their analytic capabilities to consistently beat market profitability.\nThe second part of the analysis looked at the trends of a larger group of Valen customers, those with a mixed set of goals including loss ratio improvement and growth. As the graph shows, they collectively maintain a competitive edge in loss ratio every year. Even in 2017, measuring against a significant market improvement, Valen customers solidly remain 4 pts ahead of the game.\nThese insurers have improved risk selection and pricing, helping them both protect their current business and win new business. This opens the door for them to undertake aggressive growth strategies and lower costs through greater efficiency, all while maintaining a loss ratio advantage.\nValen customers experience top-line premium growth,\neven when industry growth stalls.\nMaking profitable pricing and risk selection decisions allows insurers to grab market share, even when the market is flat.\nFinally, we looked at how Valen customers\u2019 growth compares to the market. Looking at 2017, the industry has leveled off but Valen customers continue to grow aggressively. At 53%, compared to 18%, Valen customers were growing at a rate 2.9x top-line market growth.\nThis study demonstrates that whatever your goal, analytics can support it.

But if the rollercoaster is commercial auto, some insurers will be happy to see the end of this ride.\nIt\u2019s no secret the commercial auto line is still feeling the pain of increased severity and rate inadequacy. Nearly a year ago, Carrier Management\u00a0stressed this point, citing higher litigation costs and larger loss incidents as causes for unfavorable claim trends. Despite rate increases, 2016 was the worst year for underwriting performance since 2001, with combined ratios growing 1.6% to 110.4% from the previous year. A recent A.M. Best report reaffirmed this and found 2017 to be equally as difficult, with rate increases of 5.4 percent, 6.1 percent, and 7.3 percent, in the first three quarters, as insurers tried to match the pace of losses. The report continues with the grim outlook, \u201cthere will be more pain \u2013 owing to factors such as distracted driving and attorney involvement- before insurers realize any long-term gains from focused underwriting and pricing efforts.\u201d\nWhile the uncertainty of the situation may be unsettling, about 20% of commercial auto carriers are turning an underwriting profit on this line. What do they know that others don\u2019t and what are they doing differently? More importantly, will it remain at 20%? Or, 18 months from now will we see the number of profitable insurers grow?\nIf we take personal auto as an example, there are several indicators of how this will likely play out. For the past six years, profitable personal auto insurers have attributed their success to the adoption of data analytics. To beat adverse selection, they have effectively leveraged data to choose the right risks, for the right price. This example has also played out effectively in work comp, with the top carriers vying for market share over the last 5 years.\nIndependent rating agencies like AM Best and Fitch agree: insurers that fail to adopt the advanced analytics and enhanced data to make competitive decisions will be unable to compete. It boils down to those that have incorporated analytics, and those who have not.

He clearly articulates the focused vision, strategy and execution of the USOC. I was particularly struck by how data-driven the decisions are at USOC in terms of deciding which sports to invest in, how to evaluate the potential for individual performers to win on the world stage, and where to allocate limited resources. As Charlie explained, the USOC\u2019s budget is substantially less than that of other countries. The USOC has a $250M operating budget, compared to the billions spent by the governments of China and Russia.\nWhile they leverage analytics to drive strategic investment decisions, they don\u2019t lack heart. Charlie remarked, \u201cWe\u2019re not managing widgets here. We\u2019re managing the hopes and dreams of the best athletes in the world. What we decide has an enormous impact on individuals.\u201d The average income of a U.S. Olympic athlete is just $20,000, and only a small handful develop lucrative sponsorships. These athletes are definitely not in it for the money. They dedicate years of their lives to pursue their passion and achieve incredible heights.\n\nOur whole team was inspired by the visit and moved by the energy Charlie shared during our few hours with him. Reflecting on the experience, I thought about how well Charlie laid out what we all read in business books on effective leadership and high performing teams. I won\u2019t do his storytelling justice in this post, but wanted to share what I took away.\nThe Why:\u00a0The USOC helps athletes prepare over 4 years for seconds of competition.\nThe Goal: Invest in athletes and sports where we have the best chance to medal.\nThe How: Let data and information inform your successes and failures, and guide where to steer the ship. The most critical decisions are determining what to keep doing, what to scrap, and what will work if you try to execute another way.\nThe Tough Reality: Sometimes U.S. athletes at the top of their game are unlikely to achieve the set goal of winning a medal, and will not get the resources that others will. It could be the result of the competitive landscape and assessing that our best isn\u2019t enough to win against athletes from other countries. It could be the unfortunate reality that other countries allow their athletes to cheat by doping in a particular sport and we can\u2019t overcome that obstacle.\n\n\n\nTaking Risks: There are several cases where the USOC decides conditions have changed and it\u2019s the right time to take a chance and invest in a sport where we\u2019ve struggled. In those situations, most recently with boxing and cycling, the USOC is incredibly thoughtful about the dedication and investment in tools, coaches, and other resources that will set up our athletes for success. The new boxing facility and coaching staff, led by Billy Walsh is case in point. As is an enclosed training room to help cyclists and triathletes, equipped with cycles and treadmills that can change 25k feet in altitude, and mimic extreme weather and humidity conditions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Culture: Building a team of A players requires that you compete with passion and heart. Once you seed the team with top performers, you begin the journey of bringing more people of that same caliber. Charlie shared the challenge in getting professional basketball players interested in the Olympics, until the 1992 Dream Team. Professional players began flocking to join the team.\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Execution: At the end of the day, it all comes down to execution. If Charlie said it once, he said it a dozen times:\u00a0\u201cWe can\u2019t outspend so we out execute.\u201d\u00a0He showed us so many examples of the little things that add up to a world-class Olympic team that shines in every Olympic Games. They \u2018out execute\u2019 on the smallest details of designing the training facility and teaching athletes how to shop for and cook food in remote destinations around the world, to chartering a plane in Sochi to avoid antics with Russian customs, and sending in construction crews to Rio to improve the living conditions for athletes. Details as small and important as shipping in better mattresses are meticulously planned and executed.\n\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s valuable perspective to see what goes into supporting athletes, living on such a humble income, to give them the best chance at stretching themselves to be the best in the world. Those medal winners get to enjoy a moment of glory after years of unbelievable hard work and dedication. Taking that same focused vision, passion for the work, attention to detail, and commitment to flawless execution is what defines the winners and losers in business too.\nKirstin Marr is CMO of\u00a0Valen Analytics, and has a passion for building great tech companies and promoting the impact of the brightest marketing professionals.\n ", "title": "It\u2019s the Little Things: What Olympians Can Teach Executives", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.17571606541606546, "subjectivity": 0.45371563251563257}, "secret-ingredient-highly-innovative-teams-change-game": {"content": "\nFor a unique twist on #FunFriday during #InsuranceCareersMonth, let\u2019s go inside the cultures of successful tech companies. Because insurance organizations are in a state of flux as they evolve to become more data and analytically-driven, I thought it would be helpful to expose a few trade secrets of game-changing teams.\nInnovators on the leading edge have some common personality characteristics. Bravado, moxie, and irreverence are a few words that fit the bill. Naturally, everyone in business must be resilient and tough to succeed regardless of the type of company \u2013 being competitive and remaining on top is not for the faint of heart. Yet, there\u2019s something different and special about technology leaders. When I use the term \u2018leaders\u2019 in this context, I don\u2019t mean people with executive titles. I mean individuals who have the smarts, the vision, and the gumption to change an industry. When these individuals organize into teams, they become pioneers, they push each other to go rogue and defy the status quo, and they are proud of it.\nTeams that push the envelope live the mantra, work hard and play hard. Working hard and driving an industry to new heights requires brutal honesty with yourself and your colleagues. You have to trust each other and push back on one another \u2013 which usually means there\u2019s a healthy dose of sarcasm flying around in email, IMs and internal meetings. Poking fun and prodding each other definitely serves as a release valve in the pressure cooker environment of leading tech companies. Early on, work-life balance is a laughable joke. A great leader I admire is Andy Zurcher, who I worked with at HomeAdvisor. HomeAdvisor (previously called ServiceMagic), changed the home improvement industry by building the predominant online marketplace to connect homeowners with reputable service providers. Andy led the product team in HomeAdvisor\u2019s formative years, and he used to say, \u201cEvery Friday night I go home completely drained from the week\u2019s work. When I look back at what we had accomplished since Monday, and I\u2019m always amazed at our progress. It\u2019s truly remarkable.\u201d\nFor this #FunFriday question, why is the ability to banter with your colleagues a key secret ingredient to innovation in the workplace? When it\u2019s reciprocal in a team that enjoys mutual respect, it\u2019s a sign of authentic trust. When evaluating any team, I always look for signs that they have a good time with each other and don\u2019t take themselves too seriously. In my view, it\u2019s a pivotal key to success.\nThe play hard part of the equation is important too. Valen\u2019s parent company, Insurity, just rolled out new core values \u2013 and one of them is to Celebrate Together. We fully embrace that value at Valen, and just last week had a memorable outing to celebrate record-breaking sales growth in 2017. We enjoyed a real treat staying at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, tore it up at bowling and the singing piano bar, the Golden Bee. The next morning, while a tad slow from the previous evening\u2019s festivities, we enjoyed an incredible private tour at the USOC Training Facility from their VP of U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Foundation, Charlie Huebner. Given the Olympics just kicked off, the timing and meaning of the visit was special.\nFor next week\u2019s #MondayMotivation, I\u2019ll share leadership insights from Charlie Huebner that will inspire you \u2013 he is remarkable. In the meantime, enjoy your #FunFriday with some good-natured humor with your team members!

Commercial lines underwriting is undergoing a transformation. And, underwriters need better tools to make more informed decisions that drive profitable growth and reduce losses.\u00a0 I recently came across a panel topic for an upcoming conference called \u201cEnabling the Underwriter of the Future\u201d.\u00a0 A candid description of the session called out the fact that commercial lines is essentially at a crossroads, and it\u2019s time to move forward with data, technology and tools that will attract the next generation of underwriting talent to the industry.\n\nAt the same time, Insurance Networking News just published a great article in their latest issue called \u201cThe New Data-Driven Insurer\u201d. In it, they detail a report from analyst firm SMA showing where P&C insurers are increasing their technology investments to improve overall performance. The top area for technology investment in 2013 is data and analytics initiatives that support underwriting, with 55% of insurers increasing spending. Other investments are going to support marketing (46%) and claims (37%).\nXL Group\u2019s IT leader, Kurt Schulenburg, framed up the underwriting challenge this way: \u201cIf we wanted to go back and look at all the risks that have shared characteristics, we\u2019d have to assemble a bunch of Excel spreadsheets and emails\u2026When you work in a manual environment, all you\u2019re able to use is the experience of the underwriter. What we are trying to get to is a combination model, where we use the experience of the underwriter, but we augment that with better analytics and more data from prior years.\u201d\nWe couldn\u2019t agree more. Underwriters bring valuable expertise that needs to be supported by allowing them to leverage data from claims, underwriting, agents and pricing. And, it needs to be seamless and real time within the underwriting workflow. The underwriter of the future will be able to unlock the power of data and analytics to aggressively price the best risks, avoid the poor ones and run at a profit that\u2019s sustainable and supports growth.\nIf your organization is on a journey to become more analytically driven, use Valen\u2019s Analytical Readiness checklist to ask the tough questions and facilitate dialogue internally with your team.\n ", "title": "Who is the Underwriter of the Future?", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.21007733585858582, "subjectivity": 0.3589962121212122}, "predictive-analytics-helps-insurance-agents-customers": {"content": "\nExcerpt originally published in American Agent & Broker Magazine\nAs agents and brokers, you represent high standards of professionalism and responsibility for your clients. Main street businesses and homeowners rely on your ability to secure the best insurance coverage at the most reasonable cost. That\u2019s particularly true during challenging times when hard hit coastal areas experience more severe and frequent catastrophes that require increased resources from the insurance industry. According to BusinessWeek, the number of natural disasters costing $1 billion or more has doubled since 1996 when compared with the previous 15-year period. As the industry seeks to adapt, predictive analytics is one way insurers will protect their bottom line and make needed investments in technology and enhanced customer service capabilities.\n\nIntro to Predictive Analytics\nPredictive analytics uses statistical and analytical techniques to develop predictive models that enable accurate predictions about future outcomes. Predictive models can take various forms, with most models generating a score that indicates the likelihood a given future scenario will occur. For instance, a predictive model can identify the probability that a policy will have a claim.\nWhy Carriers Are Turning to Predictive Analytics\nThere\u2019s no question that technology has fundamentally changed the pace of business. Your customers demand a faster response time, which means underwriters need to return quotes to you more quickly. Consider the example of FirstComp, reported by The Motley Fool in May 2011. FirstComp created a straight forward online interface for agents to request workers\u2019 compensation quotes. What they found was remarkable. When they provided a quote within one minute of the agent\u2019s request, they booked that policy 52% of the time. However, their success percentage declined with each passing hour they waited to respond with a quote. In fact, if FirstComp waited a full 24 hours to respond, their close rate plummeted to 30 percent.\nAdded to these new industry dynamics is the reality that both workers\u2019 compensation and homeowners are highly unprofitable for carriers. The average combined ratio for workers\u2019 comp is 115 percent (100 percent is break even; anything above 100 percent represents an underwriting loss for the carrier).\nA similarly bleak picture emerges when you look at the performance of homeowners insurance. The average combined ratio for homeowners carriers from 2008-2011 was 113 percent compared to 102 percent across all property and casualty lines of business. In order to improve their companies\u2019 performance and better meet the needs of agents, underwriters need advanced tools and methodologies that provide access to information in real-time.\nHow Does Predictive Analytics Help Insurance Agents?\nMaintaining a viable, diverse insurance market is valuable for the independent insurance agent market. Predictive analytics helps insurance carriers manage and spread risk much more effectively by segmenting higher risk policies from lower risk policies.\n\nPricing Advantages for Better Risks: When policyholders with favorable claims outcomes and risk profiles are more easily and reliably identified, they will receive better pricing.\nMore relevant, individualized policy reviews: Rather than make wholesale judgments about certain types of businesses or homes, underwriters make better informed decisions on individual policies when they have more relevant data available. For instance, an underwriter can use predictive analytics to discern that Roofing Company A is a better risk than Roofing Company B.\nGreater Efficiency: A big part of providing good customer service today depends on the speed of your response. Customers expect information to be instantly available and insurance carriers incorporating predictive analytics are able to quote business faster and more accurately.\nMaintain Choice and Market Stability: Carriers suffering from poor systemic performance negatively impact their ability to pay claims. You want to choose the best carrier for your customer and have confidence that the carrier will be around for the long term.\n\nAs with any new innovation, the way predictive analytics is implemented will determine its success. Fortunately, insurers have learned from early mistakes and made great strides in understanding how to build valid predictive models and integrate these models into their operations in a way that improves decision making and improves agent response times.\n ", "title": "How Predictive Analytics Helps Insurance Agents and Your Customers", "author": "\nBy Dax Craig\n", "polarity": 0.2885074345943911, "subjectivity": 0.4906113934374804}, "5-top-challenges-carriers-face-rapidly-changing-industry": {"content": "\nExcerpt from full article originally published on Insurance Thought Leadership\nInsurance carriers have been hit hard not only by the declines in the financial market, but from converging industry dynamics that in combination magnify their impact. Executives now find themselves at a crossroads: identify the relevant issues and adapt, or continue using outdated approaches which are quickly becoming relics of a bygone era.\n\nAre we in a hard market?\nAccording to MarketScout, the average property/casualty rate increased by 5% from 2011 to 2012, with this same upward trend continuing into 2013. And yet, just last week the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers (CIAB) reported that rate increases in the second quarter did not keep pace with the previous two quarters. The reality is that, while carriers are seeing much lower returns on investment income, there is an increase in total surplus dollars relative to total premium. This dynamic makes sustaining a hard market difficult and therefore pricing competition for the best risks continues to be fierce.\nTackling Economic Stagnancy\nA sluggish economic recovery affects insurance premiums. For commercial lines carriers, the slow growth in payroll means that overall exposure is not increasing at the same rate as medical inflation. Various estimates put medical inflation in the 4% range for 2012 and payroll growth under 2%.\nRegulation Woes\nAccording to the 2013 KPMG survey, 60% of executives stated that regulatory and legislative pressures served as the most significant inhibitor of growth in the coming year, a 13% increase from the 2012 survey, and 19% from 2011\u2019s.\nData Access & Literacy\nAccording to a KPMG study, only 55% of execs claimed that their company demonstrated advanced data and analytics literacy. If the other 45% want to stay competitive, they need to make analytics a top priority moving forward.\nBig data is now a board level conversation, and carriers are being asked: \u201cWhat is your big data strategy?\u201d When that question arises in your meeting, will you have a good answer?\nTalent Crisis The industry is estimated to have 400,000 positions to fill by 2020, and 20 percent of underwriters will retire in the next few years.

We have a large database containing four million workers compensation insurance policies, which allows us to gain insights into industry trends. When we examined the four-year period between 2008 through 2011, we found that construction has the largest percentage of misclassified payroll resulting in an average of 14%, or $76.8 billion in post-recession payroll out of the 20 distinct industries identified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\n\nTop Class Codes\nAfter conducting a nationwide study of misclassification, Valen researchers were able to narrow the findings to 15 job classification codes. Valen\u2019s data modeling team analyzed 106 class codes within construction, classifying the top 15 as key drivers of misclassification, which account for 75%, or $57.6 billion of the total $76.8 billion in misclassified payroll. The total misclassified payroll amount is based on the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 payroll for construction.\nWhy Misclassification Matters to Construction Owners\nWhen an industry has significant misclassification issues, it can affect the premiums all companies in that industry pay. To be fair, part of the reason construction ranks as the highest industry for misclassification is because it is the most heavily scrutinized. There are many more job classification categories in construction than other industries, which also means there is a wide variance in the insurance rates companies are charged. Misclassified payroll is typically identified following an audit, and larger accounts have a higher likelihood of being audited. It\u2019s understandable when you think about the difficulty an auditor faces in tracking down the hundreds of thousands of small construction companies with owners in the field every day.\nBeing prepared for a workers compensation insurance audit is critical.

The recent financial crisis changed that: insurers became incentivized to shift their focus as yields became more unpredictable than ever. As insurance carriers looked to the future, they know that running a profitable underwriting operation is critical to their long term stability.\nProfitable underwriting is easier said than done. Insurers already have highly competent teams of underwriters, so the big question becomes, \u201cHow do I make my underwriting operation as efficient and profitable as possible without creating massive disruptions with my current processes?\u201d\n\nThere are three core challenges that are standing in the way:\n\nLack of Visibility: Although you may be familiar with a specific segment of the market, do you really know how well your portfolio is performing against the industry, or how volume and profit tradeoffs are impacting your overall performance?\nCurrent Pricing Approach: You know the agents that underwriters engage with every day want you to give them the right price for the right risk, and it\u2019s not easy. In fact, it\u2019s nearly impossible. Underwriters are often asked to make decisions based on limited industry data and a limited set of risk characteristics that may or may not be properly weighted.\nInertia: When executives talk about how to solve these challenges around visibility and pricing, most admit they\u2019re concerned about how to overcome corporate inertia and institutional bias. The last thing you want to do is lead a large change initiative and end up alienating your agents, your analysts, and your underwriters.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong and growing desire to take advantage of new sources of information and modern tools to help underwriters make risk selection and pricing decisions. The implementation of predictive analytics, in particular, is becoming a necessity for carriers to succeed in today\u2019s marketplace. With the use of predictive analytics, underwriters gain visibility into their portfolio and a deeper understanding of their portfolio\u2019s risk quality. Plus, underwriters will get valuable context so they understand what is driving an individual predictive score.\nJust as insurance leaders are exploring new methods to ensure profitability, underwriters are eager to adopt the analytical advancements that will solve the tough problems carriers are facing today. Expecting underwriters to take on today\u2019s challenges using yesterday\u2019s tools and yesterday\u2019s approach to pricing is no longer sustainable.

That\u2019s why Valen joined USAA, Berkshire and analyst firm, SMA, on an expert panel discussion about implementing predictive analytics in underwriting this week at the IASA 2013 conference. Using real case studies, we explained how predictive modeling improves underwriting profitability. And, most importantly, we talked candidly about the obstacles carriers will face when introducing predictive scores to underwriters.\n\nRich Kirstie, Chief Technical Officer and Chief Actuary for Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, described the paradigm shift an underwriting organization goes through when learning to use predictive analytics. At first, underwriters are often resistant and look for ways to poke holes in a predictive model. They find individual policy scores that contradict their experience and show it as \u201cproof\u201d that the model doesn\u2019t work. He offered key recommendations to counter this initial hurdle:\n\nEase your underwriters into using predictive scores over time. Don\u2019t be too rigid at first, until you learn how to combine the power of predictive modeling with the expertise and experience of your underwriting talent.\nSecure both senior management and middle management commitment. If senior management doesn\u2019t buy in, the project won\u2019t move forward. If middle management doesn\u2019t get on board, they won\u2019t be as helpful overcoming individual underwriter adoption issues.\n\nKaren Moritz, Manager of Data Science Analysts for USAA, agreed. She added specific things carriers can do to help provide context for how predictive modeling helps underwriters focus on the things they do that add the most value.\n\nHold focus groups with your underwriters and ask them what can be done to make them more efficient through automation. When introducing new technology, like predictive modeling, tie it back to the feedback you received in the focus group sessions.\nMake the business case for using models with data and technology that clearly shows the financial benefits.\n\nDax Craig, Valen\u2019s CEO offered a final piece of advice. Underwriters view predictive scores as a \u201cblack box\u201d. That\u2019s why we include the reasons behind the score. By giving underwriters a view into other policies that have a similar score, it provides valuable context they need to understand how policies are scored so they can make informed decisions and have productive conversations with agents.\nWhat have you found that helps underwriters find value in predictive models?\n ", "title": "What makes underwriter adoption of predictive analytics challenging?", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.10654936461388075, "subjectivity": 0.41788856304985333}, "change-doesnt-have-to-be-painful": {"content": "\nFor the past couple of weeks, we\u2019ve addressed how a lack of visibility and current pricing techniques are hurting underwriting profitability.

The last thing you want to do is lead a large change initiative and end up alienating your agents, your analysts and your underwriters.\n\nBut, what if you could discover pockets of pricing inadequacy and redundancy, and free your underwriters to do what they do best? Sound too good to be true?\nNo question, you need to find ways to get started that makes the most sense for your organization. One way to achieve that is to make advanced data and analytics available first to your leadership team, actuaries and analysts so you can translate information into meaningful, actionable insight at your discretion.\nAs an executive, being able to really understand your portfolio and analyze your book at a very granular level allows you to compare policy profiles or policy segments to deeply understand how growth / profit trade-offs might impact your overall performance. What\u2019s important is to utilize tools that provide leading indicators instead of relying on, and waiting for historical results 2-3 years down the road. That way, you\u2019ll make better decisions earlier, and stay ahead of your competition.\nBy starting with an executive-led initiative, you will learn the value of synthesizing vast amounts of data into a single value that gives you an indication about the relative risk of that policy. Then, you can open up a whole new world of possibilities for your underwriters. They won\u2019t have to worry about selecting the right risk characteristics, and assigning the appropriate weighting. In fact, you can have the confidence that even more of the right risk factors are being taken into consideration. Underwriters will be able to focus on the things they do best, like evaluate management and safety programs, or whatever those things are that you think are valuable. This is the artisan piece of underwriting. This is that critical human element that computers will never replace.\nFinding the right level of visibility and flexibility allows you to successfully adopt analytics on your terms.

We discussed in some detail the need for better market visibility and this week we focus on pricing.\nYour underwriters face significant challenges when engaging with agents every day, who want you to give them the right price for the right risk. It\u2019s not easy to balance the competing demands from agents and your own internal company goals. In fact it\u2019s nearly impossible. You\u2019ve got a team of underwriters, but they\u2019re only human \u2013 and they\u2019re being asked to make decisions based on limited industry data and a limited set of risk characteristics that may or may not be properly weighted. Imagine you\u2019re the underwriter receiving submission after submission after submission, and you can only realistically pay attention to a very specific set of risk characteristics.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll look at severity, frequency, historical loss ratio, governing class, premium size, what state you\u2019re in, what agency it\u2019s coming from, and a number of other factors. As the underwriter, you need to make decisions around, \u201cHow much weight do I assign to each of these risk characteristics?\u201d\nAnd a number of these will likely shift around quite a bit based upon the risk. Imagine how hard it is to fully understand how the importance of the class code relates to the importance of the historical loss ratio on every individual policy. For example, \u201cIs class code twice as important as average claims severity or only 25% more important?\u2019 As you cascade around, you\u2019re only looking at something like seven different risk factors. And even with this limited set of variables, it\u2019s impossible to imagine how any human can fully understand the interplay across these variables and make a confident decision about how to price a risk and segment the better risks from the worse risks.\nBecause of this complexity, underwriters have an extremely difficult time predicting the most accurate loss ratio possible. The relative importance of these variables to each other, in order to predict future loss ratio, is a mathematical problem best done by computers which enables underwriters to focus on the more nuanced attributes of a policy such as a change in management or the effect a new safety program will have. Bottom line, expecting your underwriters to take on today\u2019s challenges using yesterday\u2019s tools and yesterday\u2019s approach to pricing is no longer sustainable.\n ", "title": "It is All About Price", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.0809184279772515, "subjectivity": 0.5053995840760547}, "you-need-more-visibility": {"content": "\nReturn on Equity (ROE) has gotten hammered and across the industry, combined ratios are going in the wrong direction. You can\u2019t impact interest rates, but you can impact your loss ratios through profitable underwriting. But profitable underwriting is easier said than done. You\u2019ve got a highly competent team of underwriters, and you know they\u2019re already working as hard as they possibly can.\nSo for executives like you, the big question becomes, \u201cHow do I make my underwriting operation profitable without creating massive disruptions with my people and processes?\u201d\n\nAnd there are three core challenges that are standing in the way:\n\u2022 Lack of Visibility\n\u2022 Current Pricing Approach\n\u2022 Inertia\nWe\u2019re going to tackle each of these issues separately. Today, we\u2019ll focus on the lack of visibility. First, the approach most companies take to data makes it hard to see what\u2019s really going on in the market and within your own portfolio.\nAs you look out at the entire market, you see a number of carriers, each with their own slice of the market. You\u2019ve got a segment of the market and you know this piece well. But do you really know how well your portfolio is performing against the industry, or how volume and profit tradeoffs are impacting your overall performance?\nWithout the combination of the right data, risk models, and tools, you can\u2019t monitor your portfolio or the market at large, and can\u2019t see pockets of pricing inadequacy and redundancy. There are a growing number of options available to carriers to gain access to industry data. Valen\u2019s InsureRight Platform is one valuable tool you can consider \u2013 one we\u2019re obviously particularly keen on. But, the bigger point is that the insurance industry is rapidly advancing its data and analytics capabilities.

We\u2019ve learned a few things over the nine years we\u2019ve partnered with carriers to implement predictive models within underwriting. There\u2019s a strong and growing desire to take advantage of new sources of information and modern tools to help underwriters make risk selection and pricing decisions. At the same time, each organization needs to define how to implement sophisticated analytics for themselves.\n\nThat\u2019s what inspired the Valen team to take the framework we\u2019ve perfected over the last several years and make it accessible for your team. Our contributory database includes detailed policy and claims data that have been anonymized so that no one carrier\u2019s data is recognizable to others. Now, we\u2019re opening up access to help you understand more about the market and implement analytics in a way that fits within your process.\nIf you want to start with a management view that drives strategy and new guidelines, you can do that. If you are ready to incorporate predictive scores within the underwriting workflow and leverage management visibility to understand model adoption and performance, the InsureRight Platform is set up for that as well. Your underwriters will also benefit from this enhanced visibility. We\u2019re providing valuable context so that underwriters understand what is driving an individual predictive score, and it will no longer be a \u201cblack box\u201d to them. This visibility and flexibility allows you to successfully adopt analytics on your terms.\nBecause we see this as a breakthrough offering, we\u2019ve also created educational tools on how to improve underwriting performance that you can access online.

For me, it came a few weeks ago when AIG\u2019s CEO, Brian Duperreault, began his remarks at a recent executive conference by describing an initiative I started over 4 years ago, the\u00a0#InsuranceCareersMovement. Brian continues to be our main champion, complimenting the hard work of a global coalition putting a fresh, authentic face on insurance as an attractive career option. He repeatedly points out the unprecedented cooperation this initiative enjoys from his over 40 years of experience in insurance. In a recent\u00a0video, he reflected,\u00a0\u201cThis particular movement has kind of blown me away in the sense that it has been embraced by so many, in such a positive way. I haven\u2019t seen the cooperation at this level before.\u201d\u00a0How often do you get the satisfaction of seeing someone of Brian\u2019s stature recognize something you pioneered, and see so many prominent CEOs join in? CEOs including Inga Beale from Lloyds, Mike McGavick from XL Caitlin, Mark Watson of Argo Group, Pina Albo of Hamilton Group, Dan Glaser of Marsh & McClennan, and many others.\nWhile not always so publicly grand, I\u2019ve been incredibly blessed by a career filled with unique experiences, having been part of companies that figured out how to create pivotal moments and propel their momentum forward to impact the way we run our businesses and live our daily lives. Why have I been so lucky? There are many reasons, but we\u2019ll focus in today on two themes.\u00a0\u00a0\n#1: Take calculated risks and go beyond your depth.\u00a0You don\u2019t need a fully figured out plan to jump at a new opportunity. In each of my roles, there have been numerous things I\u2019ve learned on the job. I\u2019ve had to persevere despite the butterflies in my stomach and doubts about whether I\u2019d be able to figure it out. One thing I\u2019ve always done is to seek out people who are experts in what I\u2019m trying to accomplish, and ask for advice. I\u2019ve never been afraid to freely admit what I don\u2019t know, which has allowed me to learn quickly from others who have gone before me. I\u2019m on the board of the Colorado Women\u2019s Hall of Fame, and recently had the privilege of interviewing the first woman in our state to be State Treasurer and Lieutenant Governor, Gail Schoettler. Gail is being inducted into the Hall of Fame this March. She is so driven and inspiring, and she shared with me that\u00a0\u201cLife always finds a way if you are open-minded\u2026 As you get older, you have more people to ask for advice along with considering your own life experiences. My advice is always to get out there and experience as much as you can. Look beyond what you can learn at your job, participate with non-profits, community organizations, and other venues to expand your world view.\u201d\n#2: Create value in your industry beyond your own self-interest.\u00a0The whole notion of elevating the game in insurance compelled me to find partners to build this talent initiative. My company Valen has nothing to sell related to talent recruitment or development. We provide advanced data analytics to help insurers make more informed decisions about risk assessment, pricing, customer acquisition and claims handling. Where this initiative aligns with our self-interest is in our need to reach CEOs with a vision about the importance of evolving their organizations to be more analytically-driven, and the need to recruit tech-savvy talent to make that happen. With efforts like this, there\u2019s not a direct correlation to sales at first, and you do take a leap of faith that the goodwill being created will pay dividends once momentum builds. I credit Valen\u2019s CEO, Dax Craig, with giving me the leeway to see it through. It\u2019s not an easy decision for companies, because we all have limited resources and abilities to focus on the most important priorities every quarter.\nFor today\u2019s #MondayMotivation, I encourage you to create a vision for your career that allows you to build a network focused on taking risks and furthering the collective good. It can absolutely create goosebump moments by enriching your own sense of purpose, contribution and impact. #MakeItHappen #You\u2019veGotThis\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr, CMO of Valen Analytics, has a passion for building companies that invent leading-edge technologies to improve customers\u2019 lives and solve the inefficiencies that exist in traditional marketplaces.

It was hard to imagine then that Netflix would emerge the leader one day, and eventually cause Blockbuster to close their doors. What did Blockbuster miss?\nBrick and mortar retail stores continue to face an all-out assault and a new shopping paradigm, led by Amazon. In a world where it\u2019s more challenging to compete, market share consolidation is very real and moves incredibly quickly. For property and casualty insurers there\u2019s a significant divide between those who embrace data analytics to better compete and those who don\u2019t. What sets them apart?\nThe Top 10\nIn analyzing the top 10 workers\u2019 compensation carriers in 2016, the data provides a handful of indicators:\n\n\u00a0\nFor the companies who have been on this list since 2009, many of their percentages indicate a positive increase in net premiums written and often those companies, like Berkshire Hathaway, are seen as profitable. It\u2019s a safe assumption that they are leveraging advanced data and analytics to play in the market. Texas Mutual made the list in 2014 when the same study was conducted, but as of 2016 had been replaced. Companies like AmTrust and Old Republic, in turn, have since found their way into the top 10.\nWhat similar lesson can we learn from Blockbuster? After being the leader, streaming services from the likes of Netflix changed the game. They came in and won with more sophisticated customer segmentation, a new pricing model and a different experience that recognized the need to eliminate late fees. Blockbuster had largely been profitable by penalizing customers for late fees, and when streaming services started to pose a threat, Blockbuster leadership did not want to adopt the same initiatives in order to compete.\nConversely, the top work comp carriers of 2016 show a commitment to combining a data-driven strategy with underwriting expertise to produce measurable outcomes.\u00a0 Analytically-driven companies understand risk quality at the policy level, rather than making assumptions on particular classes, geographies, or other isolated factors. Being more granular allows insurers to compete and win the best risks and align price to risk, which ultimately drives higher profitability.\nThe companies who don\u2019t adopt this more sophisticated approach will find themselves suffering from the volatility of market share consolidation, rather than benefiting from it.\nWhat\u2019s next? \nAt the beginning of 2018, A.M. Best upgraded their outlook for commercial lines from negative to stable. According to the briefing, much of this is credited towards the adoption and leveraging of predictive analytics by insurers \u201cto better establish pricing at both the line of business/classification and individual risk levels.\u201d\u00a0 The briefing also notes the more widespread use of predictive analytics by carriers of all sizes, not just larger carriers with significant data and IT resources.\nThis points to an opportunity for insurers who are still on the fence to embrace change to better understand market conditions and cut into the competition. Without the fundamentals of a data-driven strategy, those insurers could find themselves victim to market consolidation at the hands of a better-positioned carrier.\u00a0\u00a0 To learn more about this, please read Valen\u2019s\u00a02018 Outlook Report.\nIn such a competitive world, it\u2019s better to be a sought-after Netflix, rather than a distant Blockbuster memory.\n ", "title": "Market Share Consolidation Moves Quickly", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.23309807678660138, "subjectivity": 0.47955184160102193}, "clock-strikes-midnight": {"content": "\nAll year, we\u2019ve continually asked ourselves the same question: \u201cOn New Year\u2019s Eve, what will we be celebrating at the stroke of midnight?\u201d\n2017 has been full of opportunity, growth, challenge and new trajectories and gives us much to be proud of. And so much of it is thanks to you.\nHere are a few of Valen\u2019s 2017 greatest hits:\n\u00a0\nThe Insurity Acquisition \nThe Insurity acquisition happened in January and represents the start of an exciting new chapter for Valen. This provides Valen with more depth and breadth, to service both our/ Insurity clients as well as prospective ones. \u00a0As we look to 2018, product innovation is at the forefront for Insurity and there will be several key announcements in the coming months.\n\u00a0\nInsurance Careers Movement \nValen is an original founder, and one of the biggest supporters, of the Insurance Careers Movement. The movement is exploding! And gaining interest at a rapid speed, with nearly 850 organizations currently involved. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, it was even covered on the front page of the Wall Street Journal!\nThe third annual Insurance Careers Month in February 2018 is being launched with another CEO Town Hall featuring Brian Duperreault, Inga Beale, Dan Glaser, Pina Albo and many more. A.M. Best is hosting this global event on Feb. 1st at noon EST. Registration opens next week, so please sign up on the\u00a0website to receive the invite.\n\u00a0\nValen Summit \nThe fourth annual Valen Summit, held in beautiful Vail, Colorado was a rousing success. The Summit helps executives lead their organizations in the cultural revolution happening within insurance, as the industry moves toward becoming analytically-driven and making better-informed decisions by leveraging advanced data analytics.\u00a0 We look forward to the end of February when we will be holding the fifth annual Summit in Winter Park, Colorado.\n\u00a0\nValen Client Success\nOver the year we\u2019ve seen lots of exciting client developments. The most important yardstick for us is delivering measurable outcomes for our clients. Each year, we publicly release a\u00a0\u00a05-year ROI study. This year, 16 work comp carriers were included, representing over $1.76 billion in premium. While the overall work comp market has been improving, Valen clients crush the industry average in both loss ratio improvement and premium growth. Our clients\u2019 accident year loss ratio improved 1.9x compared to the industry, while their direct written premium grew 2.9x (53% vs 19% growth for the industry overall.)\nWe also continued to grow and serve more clients in work comp and commercial auto. We\u2019ve entered new markets including medical stop loss, claims, data, and we\u2019ve begun offering our InsureRight platform to support clients who are deploying their own models. We helped launch Pie Insurance at InsureTech Connect which was an incredibly dynamic experience.\n\u00a0\nInsurance Challenges \nIn light of all these exciting events, it\u2019s important to look forward and we would be remiss to not mention some of the more difficult aspects of the year. 2017 brought a series of natural disasters that devastated communities and left people to rebuild their lives. This poses a challenge for insurers moving forward, who provide an important service allowing businesses and consumers to thrive and take risks with a safety net when they need it.\n2017 was certainly busy, but we look forward to 2018 and what the year will bring. We\u2019ve already released our 2018 Outlook Report which discusses the divide that exists in the Industry.\u00a0 What is the divide in our industry and why does it matter? Check out the report for yourself!\nOverall, at midnight, we will be clinking our glasses to you. Thank you for your support. Thank you for looking to Valen in 2017 to not only support your business initiatives, but also as a thought leader. As a trusted partner, and as a friend.

Once thought lost, it resurfaced in the early 2000\u2019s and sold for the astronomical price of $450 million.\u00a0 But equally as impressive were the years of significant restoration work that brought the painting from obscurity to life.\nHaving only completed a handful of paintings in his impressive lifetime, each DaVinci is a genuine masterpiece. The upkeep requires teams of skilled restoration artists, historians and many others to keep the work true, but also incorporate the science to help withstand the ages. Predictive models, like any piece of art, any car, any human body, need maintenance. Here are some important reasons why:\n\u00a0Model Refresh\nModels are built on an initial set of variables. But over time, they need an update to account for previously uncalibrated variables that become more relevant. Models can undergo a \u201crefresh\u201d to accommodate for this, to help optimize performance and adoption as well as more targeted insight.\nRates Changes \nInsurers often handle rate updates on their own. But do those rate changes get factored into models? If not, insurers may not comprehend the impact on the models, in essence, flying blind.\nTraining \nUnderwriters may go through training when a model is initially introduced. But professional underwriting experience and working with a model over time provide greater insight and a gut check to how models work. This also helps boost adoption and usage. Continuing education for all parties involved is important.\nExecutive Strategy \nData is a powerful tool and it can be used to make strategic business decisions. Sometimes that insight can come from a third party with a bigger view. Valen\u2019s \u00a0Manage application, for example, uses leading indicators to provide an entirely new set of metrics and deeper knowledge not previously available. It can be crucial in providing executive insight to shape growth, expansion and overarching strategies.\nIf you\u2019ve spent the resources for the model, you need to invest in keeping it at its full capacity to achieve business goals and measurable outcomes.\nWith some maintenance, DaVinci\u2019s painting is seeing a new light of day. Is it time for you to do the same? Let us know if you are interested in a consultation for your current model.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr, CMO of Valen Analytics, has a passion for building companies that invent leading-edge technologies to improve customers\u2019 lives and solve the inefficiencies that exist in traditional marketplaces.

With Thanksgiving kicking off the holiday season, it\u2019s a good time to reflect on the year and what we are grateful for.\nWhen I look at the industry, I think of a handful of things.\n\u00a0\nInnovation \nThere is a lot of disruption hitting insurance, much of it focused on improving the customer experience. Customer centricity means greater transparency, better touchpoints, and better methods of digesting complicated concepts.\nThe industry now has the chance to step up, and I\u2019m grateful for this growing commitment to the customer.\u00a0 Companies listening, differentiating and delivering means a relationship that goes far beyond a claim.\n\u00a0\nPushing the Envelope \nThis year, our annual ROI study found that 16 of Valen\u2019s work comp clients have experienced 53% growth in premiums (three times better than the industry) and a 25-point reduction in loss ratio (two times better than the industry). This demonstrates our customers\u2019 committment to being strategic, getting ahead of the curve and successfully adopting data-driven technologies.\nWe\u2019ve been able to help our customers achieve these targets. But we\u2019ve also been able to help new entrants. Pie Insurance, which Valen helped launch last month at InsureTech Connect, is one such example. While Pie is spearheading an all- digital experience for purchasing work comp insurance, they leverage the application of data driven technologies to provide transparency and to revolutionize commercial lines.\nI\u2019m grateful for the many different companies that continue to push the envelope to make a difference.\n\u00a0\nValues \nValues are important. They drive what we do, how we behave, and what we stand for.\u00a0 As a matter of fact, one Silicon Valley study found 100% of value-driven companies succeed.\nI have always believed in values, and built Valen in the same way.\u00a0 When we were acquired by Insurity in January, it was natural fit because our values heavily align. For example, the commitment to move mountains \u2013\u00a0 to have the courage to take on big challenges, work as a united team, overcome obstacles with urgency and satisfy the needs of customers is important. And equally, doing the right thing and being open, honest and transparent, is a golden rule for our customers, partners and co-workers.\nI\u2019m grateful that we are in business because of these values, and that we do business with those that share the same mindset.\n\u00a0\nTaking Care of People \nNo question, it\u2019s been a challenging year for insurers. With the pain experienced by Harvey, Irma and Maria, getting policyholders\u2019 lives back on track is no easy feat.\nWhile the extent of damages has not been fully assessed, insurance exists for the sole purpose of sharing risk. This provides people with a safety net to own cars, homes, start businesses ect. When a disaster strikes, this is the most visible of insurance applications, in doing good and getting people back on their feet.\nI\u2019m grateful that insurance can sustain itself, but can also take care of people when they need it most.\nI\u2019d love to hear what you are grateful for this time of year. Feel free to find me on LinkedIn\u00a0and share your thoughts. I encourage you to think of the ways that you can make a difference both this holiday season, and on to 2018.

A family is sound asleep, when suddenly their house is on fire. Thanks to the motion sensor technology of their video doorbell, the family was alerted just in time, and able to evacuate safely while help arrived. Why did this story make the technology founder weep on stage of InsureTech Connect?\nThere\u2019s no doubt that InsureTech is exploding, and the second annual conference proved it. An Accenture statistic found that $6.3 billion had been invested by July 2017, and the energy of last month\u2019s conference proved it. The landscape is full of bustling disruptors excited to take insurance into the future.\nHere are some of the biggest takeaways where insurers must take note.\nWhy disruption is important\nDuring his session, Mike McGavick, CEO of XL Catlin, said insurance is becoming less relevant, but with the caveat that now is the opportunity to turn it around. To that end, lots of new companies are shaking things up. For example, Insurance-as-a-Service is a new concept providing a digital and seamless customer experience in Europe. With looser regulatory environments there, companies like Qover are pioneering this concept, with the backing of established insurers like Lloyd\u2019s of London.\nInnovation is everywhere\nFrom drones to doorbells, technology is rapidly striving to answer insurer challenges. It\u2019s important to work out the kinks, and know failure is part of the process. Ring founder, James Siminoff, spoke of the various iterations it took to make his video doorbell come to life. After proving it helped stem home burglaries, ultimately a partnership with American Family came to fruition.\nThis partnership was a fundamental synergy in providing a customer with more value, other than when they need help. \u201cWe want to leverage technology and partner with companies equally committed to preventing those events from happening\u2026 our customers can voluntarily enroll in this program and have their deductibles reimbursed if burglarized,\u201d American Family\u2019s Director of Innovation, James Rist, said in the press release.\nTechnology brings the need to be agile. Fail, learn from mistakes and keep innovating. This is what InsureTech is bringing to the table that incumbents should use internally to drive innovation and maintain relevance.\nCustomer Centricity\nCommercial lines have yet to experience the type of disruption that personal lines have. Seizing on this opportunity, Pie Insurance, a new entrant to the workers\u2019 compensation market, discovered that 65% of small businesses overpay relative to their empirical risk level, by an average of 29% for workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\nPie launched at InsureTech Connect focused on making workers\u2019 compensation insurance easier and more streamlined to get, less complicated and with greater transparency. \u201cThe traditional high-touch approach agents and underwriters use in commercial lines leads to high prices and a protracted customer experience. Yet, the profitability in this sector indicates that small accounts are subsidizing larger accounts at most insurance companies. By focusing exclusively on small businesses with a digitally enabled solution, Pie will solve this problem at scale,\u201d said Pie CEO, John Swigart.\nWhy is this all important?\nThis is insurance at its best. InsureTech is only going to produce more and more companies trying to solve insurer challenges, but they will need help. Those who choose to embrace technologies may ultimately be providing the most benefit to their customers overall. Dax Craig, CEO of Valen, built the company on the same principle. \u201cWe started Valen on the two key tenets that our products must provide demonstrable return on investment for the customer and have a positive effect on the good of man.\u00a0Read more on the Valen story.\nIt links back to the purpose of insurance.

How can the application of advanced data help curb such a problem? Here\u2019s a brief recap.\nLoss ratio reduction can be achieved three ways: increase rate, reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses, or some combination of the two. Simply raising rates in a competitive market will cause a number of policyholders to find a better deal \u2013and usually, the better quality business is the first to go. Certainly, identifying claims leakage or overpayment of losses helps address the cost side of a loss ratio problem.\nIn a commoditized insurance market, many insurers use similar rating characteristics. Traditional pricing models consider common, easily obtained characteristics, and broad classes of risk with average past performance metrics heavily influence rates.\nPredictive analytics can be used to sift through hundreds of characteristics to identify those that will separate the underpriced and overpriced risks. The resulting model can then be used to score each policy. This insight enables carriers to leapfrog over the competition by selecting only those risks that have the highest likelihood of profitability. Furthermore, the use of additional characteristics for rating creates a competitive advantage.\nIt\u2019s important to turn to predictive analytics before implementing rate increases or cutting out entire classes of business. A broad stroke approach misses the nuanced insights leveraged by sophisticated competitors, who use predictive analytics to unlock important variables and properly weight the influence of each one. Understanding these insights at a policy level helps underwriters better align price to risk, contributing to a lower loss ratio.\nWhen aligned with a comprehensive strategy and underwriter expertise, the effects can be measured. Valen recently compared the ROI of 16 work comp carriers writing a total of $1.6 billion in premium. Having used predictive analytics for at least two years, the results speak for themselves. The results of Valen clients showed a 25-point reduction in loss ratio, nearly two times better than the rest of the industry.\n\u00a0\n\nTo see an incredibly successful implementation of predictive analytics for a carrier, and how the results not only reduced loss ratio by 66%, but also won an award, read our case study.\n ", "title": "Back to Basics: Predictive Analytics and Reducing Loss Ratio", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.1195034013605442, "subjectivity": 0.5605306122448979}, "race-bottom-myth": {"content": "\nIncorporating predictive analytics requires change management, especially for underwriters using it on a regular basis for risk selection. For those using predictive analytics in underwriting, 68% of insurers have been using it for less than two years, according to Valen\u2019s own proprietary research.\nA common concern for insurers new to predictive analytics revolves around the data. If everyone is using the same data, does that mean the results look the same and eliminate any competitive edge?\nIn order to test this common perception, Valen conducted a study. The purpose was to illustrate how best practices for analytics implementation are designed to achieve specific business goals for each individual insurer, not drive toward a singular goal across insurers. In two separate tests, was a predictive model resilient to direct competitors also using a model? In a head-to-head simulation of competitive models in production, each insurer uses their own model to offer a competitive price.\n \nIn a tie result, the policy remained with the incumbent.\nIn a related scenario, the results identified a similar result. Advanced data and analytics allow insurers to know more about what they insure and make better decisions while enhancing the ability to differentiate from competitors.\n\u00a0\n \nWhat does all of this mean?\nThis exercise proves that model uniqueness and innovation provide a crucial advantage. We continually emphasize the importance of an insurer\u2019s goals and expertise combined with the innovative use and implementation of analytics.

Inadequate rates and reserves over the past few years are piling up, along with a host of additional factors. Less experienced commercial drivers, increased accidents, distracted driving, a rise in medical and litigation costs, and rising vehicle repair costs (due to better technology) all contribute to a troubled line of business.\nThe result is an unsustainable combined ratio now at a 15 year high of 110.4%, and, according to Fitch, it\u2019s having a negative impact on profits for the entire P/C industry. This ripple effect is compounded by the fact that it\u2019s also the fast-growing commercial line, with 5.6% growth in direct liability premiums for 2016.\nBetter risk selection and pricing approaches are the best places to start. If you can assess the risk and price it correctly for the exposure from the beginning, you deal with the problem at the root cause. Many insurers turn to advanced data analytics to better inform decision making. Predictive models create equal segments or \u201cbins\u201d of premium or policy counts to rank order policies from the best performing (bin 1) to the worst (bin 10). It allows insurers to take a scientific approach to reviewing policies that often look similar on the surface, and arm their underwriters with actionable insights to better align price to risk.\nOne of the biggest myths surrounding this application is the \u201cmagic bullet.\u201d Many insurers ask which vehicle class to throw out to achieve better numbers, for example. As you can see in the graph below, this isn\u2019t how it works. Risk inherently exists in every class of business; there isn\u2019t one type of business that is always lower or always higher risk. It comes down to more sophisticated ways of assessing individual policies to get the price right and book the business that fits your strategy for growing and managing your portfolio.\n\nMany insurers still have the wrong approach to understanding risk. Instead of a broad stroke, it\u2019s better to incorporate tools at the policy level that pinpoint the problem. The real magic bullet is to provide your underwriters with advanced analytics, a clear strategy, and the support of senior management to remedy the current state of commercial auto underwriting.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr, CMO of Valen Analytics, has a passion for building companies that invent leading-edge technologies to improve customers\u2019 lives and solve the inefficiencies that exist in traditional marketplaces.

When you consider how technology is reshaping the workplace and the impact of rising claims costs, it\u2019s clear change is on the horizon. What are the near-term implications for insurers? Two key areas of focus are growth and claims handling.\nGrow or die\nWork comp is the leader in commercial lines in terms of market sophistication, and the increasing use of analytics to compete on pricing. Unless your company is looking to be acquired, the race is on for grabbing market share.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAs illustrated in the chart above, savvy market segmentation and pricing strategies are allowing the top players to secure market share. Companies who want a seat at the table must be willing to adopt the necessary tactics in order to achieve substantial growth.\nAdditionally, for multi-line property and casualty carriers, expanded product offerings will be essential to reach new customers. For monoline work comp carriers, writing additional class codes and expanding geographic territories will be an important way to expand business.\nManage Severity\nAlthough work comp claims overall are down, severity is up. Since 1995, indemnity has increased 138% and lost-time claims severity has increased 214%. In comparison to previous years, NCCI states the average medical lost-time claim severity grew 5% from 2015 to 2016, an additional 3.8% in 2016. And while the change was negligible for 2017, 3.3% is already projected for 2018.\nWhen embraced early on, predictive models can help stem severity. For example, analytics can determine which claims could skyrocket, ultimate close dates and final payments amounts. They can also pinpoint when to close a claim quickly and when it\u2019s appropriate to involve a more skilled adjuster or nurse case manager.\nGet the team on board\nTelling a simple and compelling story to your team about the challenges your business is facing and the strategies you are employing to address them goes a long way to getting buy in.

The study compared the usage of a model against the underwriters\u2019 own predictions, as well as a hybrid approach.\nIn a three-part test comparison, the results yielded the following:\n\n\nUnderwriter (green line): This underwriting organization did in fact separate risks from best quality to worst quality.

It requires a sturdy blueprint, a capable team and the right resources to bring it to life.\nThe same process is true for insurers developing an advanced data and predictive analytics solution. It starts with a plan, followed by quality data, a capable team of both architects and data scientists, and a handful of other factors to successfully build and incorporate the practice into the business.\nWhile this may seem like a massive undertaking, it can be tackled in smaller, manageable steps. Here, we will address the necessary must do\u2019s regarding data whether an insurer is building, buying or creating a hybrid data solution.\nThe must do\u2019s of data collection\nHave the right team in place\nIn an ideal structure, a data engineering team will collect, cleanse and maintain an efficient database that can be leveraged by the data scientists. A data architect is best equipped to lead the data engineering team to design high-level reports for executives, append external data sources, update databases, and work closely with the data scientists to help build predictive models.\nWork in an ecosystem\nAny data project should be part of a bigger ecosystem, and the more integrated the better. The team must consider everything from the sources of data, to the integration points and even training of the end users. When all the parts play together, you have a cohesive solution that can deliver quality insights. The most common reason for failure is when the implementation hasn\u2019t been thought through. Therefore, when it\u2019s time to implement, the technical staff needs to collaborate with the business to make sure a plan is in place.\nConduct a data inventory\nIt\u2019s important to take a technical inventory of the data you are using. This provides an initial benchmark of data and relationships, and what you\u2019re working with. Things like summary statistics or data sets with no variability or poor populations are useful to know up front. Not only is this helpful initially, but also for on-going monitoring and performance evaluation of the solution.\nData cleansing\nNow it\u2019s time to evaluate if all of your data is relevant and meets expectations. This process will help you identify where the data needs to cleansed and what you could potentially remove from the model data set. You can use different types of visual diagrams to illustrate this process including heat maps, trends, aggregation models and more.\nData Governance\nAs you go through the process of inventory and cleansing, you will ultimately find things that cause you to reexamine the data. Data governance provides visibility to the changes that occur to data profiles. Keeping track of data versions, revision history and security is crucial in understanding the evolution of the data and how it influences your modeling efforts. When data governance is lacking, there are significant risks including a lack of ownership and transparency, to name a few.\nThese components make up the blueprint that becomes your overall approach to an analytics-based solution.

But if the rollercoaster is commercial auto, some insurers may be happy to get off the ride.\nIt\u2019s no secret the commercial auto industry is feeling pain. Much of it can be attributed to a soft market, high claim payouts, and inadequate ISO rates. A recent Carrier Management article re-emphasized this notion citing advanced technologies, distracted driving and poorly trained drivers resulting in unfavorable claims results. Furthermore, despite rate increases, 2016 was the worst year for underwriting performance since 2001 with combined ratios growing 1.6% to 110.4% from the previous year.\nWhile the uncertainty of the situation may seem nauseating, about 20% of commercial auto carriers are running a profit. What do they know that others don\u2019t and what are they doing differently? More importantly, will it remain at 20%? Or, 18 months from now will we see the number of profitable insurers grow?\nSeveral indicators exist on how this will play out, take personal auto for example. In the past six years, profitable personal auto insurers can attribute their success to the adoption of data and analytics. To beat adverse selection, they have effectively leveraged data to select, price business and manage claims. This example has also played out effectively in work comp, with the top carriers vying for market share over the last 5 years.\nIndependent rating agencies like AM Best and Fitch agree. With negative outlooks projected for all commercial lines, insurers that fail to adopt the advanced analytics and enhanced data to make competitive decisions will be unable to compete. It boils down to those that have incorporated analytics, and those who have not.\nIt\u2019s up to insurers to decide when to face uncertainty head-on and make investments in the future. After all, a ride on a Merry-Go-Round is much less stressful than on a rollercoaster.\nLearn how one commercial auto insurer fought adverse selection and improved their loss ratio by 29 points in our latest case study.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr, CMO of Valen Analytics, has a passion for building companies that invent leading-edge technologies to improve customers\u2019 lives and solve the inefficiencies that exist in traditional marketplaces.

Companies like Trov and Metromile have answered the call, making on-demand, usage-based insurance easy to buy and customized to the consumer needs. Recently, startups Insurify and Next Insurance went a step further, offering the ability to purchase coverage via Facebook Messenger chatbots that are able to mimic the one-to-one conversation that would normally take place with an agent. Chatbots also provide the added benefit of being powered by analytics that make fast, accurate pricing decisions. A more extreme departure from the traditional model is hard to fathom!\nBut where these companies will face a real challenge is not in the distribution, but in the back-end administration of the policies that they sell with such ease.\u00a0 In many cases, the policies are underwritten by traditional carriers, which begs the question, \u201cWhat has really changed?\u201d\nYes, it\u2019s easier and faster to buy a policy that\u2019s customized to your needs, but the biggest pain point for consumers has always been the process of filing and settling a claim. With traditional insurers handling the nuts and bolts of the claims administration, insurtech companies are falling short of transforming the entire customer experience. Lemonade has taken a different approach, becoming a fully-licensed insurance company in their own right and they\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to process and pay a claim in about 3 seconds. This kind of expedited processing, however, will be difficult, if not impossible for those startups that don\u2019t impact the entirety of a policyholder\u2019s experience.\nThis is where reinsurers have the advantage. This group of companies that has typically been a behind-the-scenes player in the game can now be the star, as they are not shackled with existing processes and systems that make it hard to change course to a customer-focused distribution model. This is not to say that traditional insurers are being left out in the cold. There is still ample opportunity to tune-in to customer needs and simplify a buying cycle that\u2019s inefficient, complex and in stark contrast to industries that allows consumers to do almost anything through a smartphone app. The challenge will be to consider the entire customer experience to transform the end-to-end process.\nMany traditional insurers have taken on the role of VC-backer, in what one can only assume is a plan to first build, then buy their way into innovation via acquisition of smaller startup companies. How this will play out remains to be seen. But one thing is sure, the power of data analytics will be key to the success of all insurers, old and new, as the customer and market demand faster and more agile transactions.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr, CMO of Valen Analytics, has a passion for building companies that invent leading-edge technologies to improve customers\u2019 lives and solve the inefficiencies that exist in traditional marketplaces.

others are purely coincidental, and not at all predictive.\u00a0 The goal of the model, in our experience, is to give the underwriter a solid, consistent base of understanding using a well-defined list of input variables.\u00a0 This frees the underwriters to consider everything else, outside of that small list of inputs.\nWhen presenting the model to a savvy group of underwriters, we almost always get these interesting questions:\n\nWhich variables does the model use?\nWhy are those variables selected?\nWhy is this other variable NOT in the model?\n\nThe easy answer, of course, is that we listen to the data \u2013 we let statistics determine which variables are important, and which are not, and make our selections accordingly.\u00a0 But what happens when the data says a variable is important, and we disagree?\u00a0 As model builders, should we substitute our intuition for solid indications?\u00a0 Or should we listen to the data, and include variables to which we object?\nThis is where model building starts to become an art, as well as a science.\u00a0 The answer to this question lies in understanding the intended application of the model\u00a0and using that understanding to determine how strictly to follow the \u201cpure\u201d indications of the data.\nHere\u2019s an example:\u00a0 What are some of the variables that underwriters would universally say are predictive of future loss?\u00a0 Probably every underwriter would agree that past losses are predictive of future losses.\u00a0 Given a choice between two identical exposures, one with no prior losses and one with several high-severity prior losses, every underwriter will choose the first risk.\nWhen we model workers\u2019 compensation risks, we find that the data backs this up: prior loss history is important.\u00a0 Technically speaking, prior loss history is correlated with future loss ratio.\u00a0 However, there is a bit of a surprise here:\u00a0 Prior loss severity is inversely correlated with future loss ratio.\nLet me restate that to be clear: Policies with large losses in prior years have LOWER future loss ratios.\n\nIt gets worse: those lower future loss ratios are on a manual basis. \u00a0This means that, all else being equal, an underwriter should prefer (or give credit to) accounts with large losses.\u00a0 What\u2019s going on here?\u00a0 Honestly, we don\u2019t know with certainty why this is true, but we see it across multiple carriers, so we believe that it\u2019s generally true.\u00a0 Some possible explanations:\n\nEmployees at these accounts with large losses are more careful in the future\nThey put safety equipment in place\nThey receive loss control services and conduct safety training\nThey adjust their scope of operations to eliminate the source of prior loss\n\nIn the end, it probably doesn\u2019t matter why; the data is clear.\u00a0 Past severity is predictive of the\u00a0future loss ratio.\u00a0 So what do we do with this?\u00a0 Do we put the claim severity variable into the model?\nNo.\nThe only thing more important than having a model that works is having a model that the underwriter understands and trusts.\u00a0 Without that trust, the underwriter will simply ignore the model indications \u2013 or will only listen to the model when it agrees with their prior intuition.\u00a0 This is equivalent to having no model at all.\u00a0 If we include this variable in a final model, we will be explicitly advising an underwriter to give preference to accounts with high-severity claims.\u00a0 This will NOT engender trust.\nSo we exclude past claim severity.\u00a0 Yes, we are deliberately removing a variable that shows predictive power, because our end goal is not merely model power, but impacting the bottom line through underwriter adoption.\u00a0 We also do one more thing: we share all of these details with the underwriters, so they\u2019re aware not only of what\u2019s IN the model\u00a0but also, what\u2019s NOT IN the model.\nWhen considering the human element, we\u2019ve found that it\u2019s just as important to talk about what\u2019s present as what\u2019s missing.\u00a0 At the end of the day, we want the underwriter to believe in the model, that it\u2019s doing the best job possible in considering what\u2019s included.\u00a0 At the same time, we want the underwriter to focus on what\u2019s not in the model because it\u2019s there that the true expertise and value of underwriting is going to be found alongside predictive analytics.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nBret Shroyer, FCAS, is an actuary and VP of Services\u00a0for Valen Analytics.

Whether it\u2019s putting on make-up, eating, dealing with small children, talking on the phone or sending a text message, drivers are often distracted from their primary focus of driving a vehicle. Hartford CEO Christopher Swift has stressed the issue and implored the public to educate friends and family about this issue that is \u201ccausing real pain for society in general.\u201d Often it occurs while people are driving to and from work, but it also happens when driving on the job, adding to the list of factors that is wreaking havoc in the world of commercial auto insurance.\nRoads in the US are seeing more automobile traffic now than ever. According to the Federal Highway Administration, the US saw a record 3.17 trillion miles traveled by vehicles in 2016, and much of this traffic comes from commercial vehicles making deliveries, service calls and transporting cargo. Unfortunately, these on-the-job drivers are not immune to the common distractions that make drivers more likely to have an accident. In fact, one study suggests that people who drive for work might be more prone to distracted driving as they\u2019re on the phone or in a hurry to reach their destination. While many employers are implementing policies to reduce these distractions and make their drivers safer, it\u2019s not been enough to slow this trend.\nIf you\u2019re a commercial auto insurer, you\u2019ve probably already seen the results of this bad habit, in the form of more frequent and severe claims. In a recent report,\u00a0 A.M. Best cited distracted driving as one of the causes for increased severity of commercial auto liability claims that contributed to an underwriting loss in the P&C industry in 2016. \u00a0In this soft market, it\u2019s hard to adjust your pricing to make sure you\u2019re getting the right rate for the risk, without losing share. \u00a0What\u2019s more, it can be extremely difficult for an insurer to know which of the risks they write is a good risk, and which is a bad risk. Looking at your own data will show a part of the picture, but if you\u2019re falling victim to adverse selection or have limited data, you may be finding more questions than answers.\u00a0 Is it possible that some of those policies you\u2019re concerned about losing due to a rate increase are bad risks that you should be aiming to avoid? This and other questions are paving a rough road ahead for this line of business.\nThere may not be a magic bullet that can solve all of these issues, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing to be done. A good place to start is with an understanding of adverse selection and how it might be impacting your business. Next, it is helpful to recognize that there are, as Valen CEO Dax Craig put it in a recent article, \u201cwinners and losers in every vehicle class.\u201d The key is to differentiate between the two and make yours an organization focused on smart, data-driven risk selections on this bumpy ride.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr is the chief brand advocate for Valen Analytics, paving the way for prospective clients to lead the innovation initiatives required to compete in today\u2019s marketplace.

With an estimated 400,000 insurance professionals expected to retire over the next couple of years, the insurance industry is battling to attract talent. The challenge doesn\u2019t end there, however. It\u2019s not just a question of back-filling positions vacated by retirees, it\u2019s also about building a workforce that\u2019s diverse demographically-speaking, as well as in skills and experience. The need to fill positions is also exacerbated by timing\u2014this problem is hitting at the same moment that carriers are retooling their operations to become more profitable, which will require data and analytics talent within IT, actuarial and underwriting departments.\nYoung professionals are looking for collaborative, socially conscious organizations \u2013 expectations that are very different than their parents and grandparents had when entering the workforce decades ago. In addition, millennials tend to have different work priorities and styles, having been raised in a tech-savvy, customer-centric world.\u00a0 It\u2019s no wonder that the reputation the industry has as one that\u2019s boring and bureaucratic can be very disparaging to new grads and young professionals.\nSo, what is the real cost of this talent crisis? Aside from the additional resources\u00a0needed for recruitment and the strain put on existing employees as positions remained unfilled, not having a diverse workforce can hurt your company\u2019s bottom line. According to a study by the American Sociological review, companies with the highest levels of racial diversity brought in nearly 15 times more sales revenue on average than those with the lowest levels of racial diversity. Furthermore, companies with more female board members achieved 66% higher performance on invested capital than those with fewer women. The stiff competition for top IT talent can delay infrastructure upgrades and new software implementations because there simply aren\u2019t enough people to get the work done quickly.\nThe good news is that this is a talent pool that\u2019s ripe for the fishing, if the industry can adapt. 51% of recent grads feel that they are underemployed and female millennials are entering the global workforce in larger numbers than ever. In the past, insurance companies built their businesses on profits from investments, but as those margins continue to dwindle and the focus shifts to underwriting profits, an emphasis on analytics talent becomes more important. To hire and retain this talent, companies must put an emphasis on diversity, understand what young professionals want and showcase the strengths of this industry: It\u2019s stable, rewarding and limitless. It\u2019s the career trifecta.\nFebruary is Insurance Careers Month (ICM) and the ICM grassroots collaboration is dedicated to spreading the word about the #CareerTrifecta. In this month, insurance professionals are being called upon to bring attention to this talent gap and all that the insurance industry has to offer \u2013 on social media, at networking events and through platforms like InVEST\u00a0and MyPath.

With 2016 in the record books, it\u2019s a good time to look back on what we learned during the past year of growth, adaptation and change.\nIf there\u2019s one lesson that 2016 sent loud and clear, it\u2019s that innovation is changing the game at every turn. At the start of the year, we anticipated that 2016 would be a year in which the industry would either embrace or fight change. The number of InsurTech start-ups is steadily growing and some are making grand plans to affect change. Although it only began selling insurance in the summer of 2016, by late December, Lemonade announced its plans to expand nationwide throughout 2017 and the company recently announced it set a world record for speed by processing and paying a claim in a mere 3 seconds.\nWhere InsurTech aims to disrupt the current distribution model and improve the customer experience, other innovations that are not specific to the insurance industry are creating a new set of challenges. In Oct 2016, former Google employees at Otto paired up with Anheuser-Busch to complete the world\u2019s first commercial shipment using a \u201cdriverless\u201d truck. Self-driving cars have been long anticipated and tested for personal use, but this commercial application was the first of its kind. Adding further complication, and blurring the line between commercial auto and cyber risk coverage is the Amazon Snowmobile \u2013 an 18-wheeler that can transport up to 100 petrabytes of data from a company\u2019s data warehouse to its cloud servers. Now an industry that\u2019s been slow to change is thrown into warp speed as what used to be science fiction has become reality and new coverage complexities emerge. What remains to be seen is how insurance will be required to adapt, develop the necessary skills to innovate and keep pace.\nThe second lesson is to keep a close eye on how traditional insurance players respond to this wave of innovation. Reinsurers are particularly interesting to watch, as low investment yields and an increasing mix of capital interests in the reinsurance space spawn new ways to invest and leverage their own capital. In fact, CB Insights has reported a 20x rise in reinsurance investments in InsurTech from 2013-2016. One big advantage reinsurers have compared to traditional carriers is that they are capable of serving the entire supply chain (from quoting to binding to claims handling) and aren\u2019t restricted by legacy systems and distribution models that primary insurers are required to navigate.\nAnd last, but certainly not least, we saw in 2016 the industry recognize that the customer is king. Policyholder customers have long been dissatisfied with interactions with their insurance companies, seeing it as a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d, rather than a positive experience. In the past year, companies have spent their time and energy not just on developing new tools for tech-hungry Millennials, but also in empowering their human workforce. As much as we love an app, it can\u2019t replace the trusted advice of an agent.\nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list of lessons from 2016, but these are three important dynamics to watch as we enter the new year. Adaptability and flexibility are now requirements in the business of mitigating risk. This is a shift not just in the way of doing business, but also in the way we think about the customer and technology-driven solutions.

For some, this new breed of competition looks like cause for uncertainty. How will the roles of underwriters and actuaries change? What about agents and producers? Will these new business models overcome the barriers to entry and undercut the industry the way Uber and Airbnb have?\nThe good news is that nimble, tech-savvy companies are riding this wave, rather than letting it take them under. This industry that has traditionally taken a stand-offish approach to new technology is demonstrating a shift in attitude and a willingness to with new tech, not against it. A recent study published to the research firm International Data Corp (IDC) reports that worldwide, spending on IT will climb from around $936 billion this year to $1.1 trillion by 2020. Cloud-related services, business process outsourcing and systems integration make up the bulk of this increased spending, but predictive analytics and R&D spending is also on the rise. In fact, analyst firm Celent reported that in 2015 data analytics initiatives outspent core systems replacement for the first time in over a decade for P&C insurers.\nIn addition to making greater investments into their own technical infrastructure, many companies are creating joint ventures with InsurTech start-ups and creating divisions within their own organization that focus on innovation. Liberty Mutual and USAA, for example, are backers of Snapsheet, a new entrant that\u2019s developing virtual auto claims technology and services. These companies recognize that while established insurers have the upper hand where financial resources, reputation and big data are concerned, the modern insurance consumer is demanding change in the form of easier, more transparent interactions with their insurance company.\nThis is not to say that all InsurTech startups will have the longevity to make a lasting impact on this well-established industry. Like many tech disruptors of the past, some are rich in drive and outside-the-box thinking, but poor in the industry-specific expertise that\u2019s needed to stand the test of time. Having a great idea is not enough. The value and sustainability of this idea will have to be tested and retested over the course of months and years to come. Supporting this test-and-learn approach requires a seismic shift in the culture of many insurers. Insurers will benefit from keeping a watchful eye on these disruptors and looking for ways in which new ideas can be applied to old business to reduce costs, increase profitability and improve the customer experience.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr is the chief brand advocate for Valen Analytics, paving the way for prospective clients to lead the innovation initiatives required to compete in today\u2019s marketplace.

Ten years ago, developing strong pricing looked different than it does today. You could rely on general pricing trends and market cycles. But now that\u2019s changed. \nSince 2008, massive changes have swept across the insurance industry. Pricing decisions now require more targeted and segmented data. Your job now demands that you get your pricing down to a science for one simple reason\u2014the onus is now on you to generate revenue and profits in an increasingly sophisticated market. \nIn addition to these challenges, you are facing new competitors in the insurance industry. \nYour traditional competitors are exploiting their technological prowess to enter your market with a definite edge. We know of one company that joined the technological momentum and lowered their loss ratio by 17%. With laser-focused data and analytics, companies like this are achieving sophisticated risk selection and are leaving the riskier policies for your firm. \nRetiring before you have to implement sweeping technological changes is no longer feasible. And as you watch numerous policies go upside down, you\u2019re wondering how much more pain\u2014and pressure\u2014you can take. \nThe good news is that there is an answer for your problems. The key to survival in today\u2019s new environment is strong pricing. \nYou can evaluate how strong your pricing is. Click here to take the\u00a0Assessment\nPricing Assessment: http://training.valen.com/assessment/\nStrong Pricing: Your Opportunity to Make More Money\nStrong pricing represents the only opportunity you have to increase your underwriting profit and lower your loss ratio. It\u2019s the only thing that will keep you from suffering from adverse selection. \nEverything else involved in your role is an expense. Once a potential policyholder has signed that contract, you are obligated to fulfill your promise and accept his or her liability. \nYou\u2019re locked into an agreement that was made on limited knowledge. There\u2019s a severe data gap between what your policyholders know about their risk and what you know. \nTo top it off, it\u2019s an agreement you can\u2019t drastically change with new information. You must have all the information you need upfront to create strong pricing. \nOther industries have the ability to adapt their actions to changing forces. If an IT company releases a flawed version of software, the answer is simple. The company creates an updated version based on the new information it\u2019s received. \nIn the insurance industry, the best opportunity to get it right is the first time. \nAs a result, you must rely on as much data as you can obtain. And even though your underwriters\u2019 discretionary pricing has been informed by actuaries, these aggregated rates still allow you to lose more. \nYour underwriters have to make individual judgments on each policy that comes their way. And where specific data doesn\u2019t inform decisions, you\u2019ll often find your underwriters rely on a big-bucket approach. \u00a0\nThe fact is that your revenue (or the lack thereof) is generated on a much more granular level. You\u2019re making and losing money policy by policy. \nIf you think that you are losing money because of an \u201cirrational market\u201d or the changing legal/statutory environment, you are misdiagnosing your problem of adverse risk selection.\nTo solve this problem and find accurate pricing, you\u2019re going to need much more specific data than your actuaries can provide. You need a narrower focus. \nIn short, your job demands that you help your underwriters find strong pricing for each policy through predictive analytics built on solid data. \nStrong Pricing: 3 Reasons Insurers Lack It \nNot every insurance company relies on predictive analytics fueled by strong inputs. In fact, many insurance companies have a flawed approach to strong pricing. \nTo see if your firm has a faulty approach to predictive analytics, evaluate the strength of your pricing tactics. Click to take Free Assessment.\nHere are 3 scenarios that might describe the situation at your firm. \n\n You\u2019re solely relying on the instincts of your underwriters.\n\nYour underwriters do have a massive amount of experience and expertise. But if you do not support them with predictive analytics, they will rely on something else much less accurate: their biases. \nBiases contain your underwriters\u2019 experiences and can help them steer clear of risky policies. However, biases can lead to neglecting policies that are profitable. \nIf a team member once underwrote a construction firm, only to absorb significant liability because of the general contractor\u2019s negligence, he or she will likely avoid other similar businesses. Not all construction companies are equal, and there are a number of variables that determine a policy\u2019s profitability. \nIf your underwriter doesn\u2019t have access to specific, easy-to-use data, you stand to lose a significant amount of money by selecting a risky policy or rejecting a profitable one. In the end, your underwriter needs the support of predictive analytics. In fact, we\u2019ve done a study that reveals the best pricing occurs when you combine predictive models with underwriter expertise. \n\n Your underwriters don\u2019t have a user-friendly predictive modeling tool. \n\nSadly, many predictive modeling tools simply aren\u2019t designed for your underwriter. If you\u2019ve integrated predictive modeling into your firm, you may think you\u2019re ahead of the curve. \nThe real question is this: Can your underwriters use the tools you give them?\nUnless you provide a user-friendly interface, you\u2019ll never tap into your valuable statistics. To see if your firm falls into this category, here are some questions to ask: \n\nAre predictive analytics delivered in a usable format? If your underwriter has to deconstruct an Excel spreadsheet to understand how to price a policy, your underwriter will have a difficult time implementing the new model of decision-making. \n\n\nDoes predictive analytics provide real-time decision support? If your underwriters can\u2019t access the data they need when they need it, then you may miss valuable opportunities. \n\n\n You lack strong data. \n\nThis third reason might be the most subtle of the reasons you lack strong pricing. \u00a0\nEven if you have a predictive, and usable, model for your underwriter, that doesn\u2019t guarantee accurately adjusted premiums. The inputs for your predictive model may be based on faulty data. \nFor one, your data may lack the breadth needed to draw accurate conclusions. But there\u2019s also another danger. \nInsurers suffer from self-selection bias. Your firm probably has a tendency to insure a certain type of policy holder more frequently than another. And when you gather data from this pool, you deal strong pricing a staggering blow. \nYour underwriters base their decisions on data from your company\u2014not the data that describes the characteristics of policyholders across the nation. Unless a policy comes from the same category as the policies you\u2019ve sampled, you have a shaky foundation for an accurate premium. \nStrong Pricing: Your Solution\nIf you suspect your firm has a shaky or ineffective pricing strategy, you can take steps now to remove the obstacle that stands between you and strong pricing. \nEvaluate your pricing practices with the How Strong Is Your Pricing? Assessment. You\u2019ll gain valuable information that reveals how your practices and strategies are either strengthening or weakening your underwriting. \nAfter you complete the assessment, you\u2019ll be given a score report. Your score will help you see where your organization falls on the strong pricing spectrum. \nDon\u2019t rely on ineffective generalizations to explain your increasing loss ratio.

As you would expect, some industries are worse than others. Looking at the years 2008 \u2013 2012, construction had the largest percentage of misclassified payroll, totaling a whopping $76.8 billion. And it might surprise you to learn that just 15 class codes represent 75% of the total problem in construction.\nYou may be asking yourself what it means if 1 out of every 2 policies you write has inaccurate payroll numbers.\nFirst, not every policy reaches a threshold where the level of misclassification is critical enough to examine. That begs the question of which policies you really need to pay attention to. A shot gun approach isn\u2019t going to be very effective in answering this question. Generally speaking, we have found that smaller policies have a higher rate of misclassification.\nSecond, it is impractical and incredibly unprofitable to physically audit every policy. That\u2019s especially true of smaller policies. The crux of the issue is that carriers are constantly dealing with information asymmetry. The insured knows exactly what their payroll is and what their employees are doing. The agent knows more about the insured than you do. The bad news is that carriers often have less information on hand about a particular insured at the point of new business.\nThe good news is that there are strategies to address the information gap that even the playing field from a data standpoint. Better yet, you can gain a competitive advantage by identifying misclassified payroll proactively. One benefit is being more exact in the types of policies to audit by going beyond traditional business rules (e.g., industry, size of policy, etc.) that trigger an audit. These blunt force tools are no longer as effective as they used to be.\nThird, in light of the work comp fraud case in New York, carriers can anticipate an increasing amount of pressure from public officials to closely monitor employers\u2019 practices. Having the right tools in place has never been more critical to stay organized and ultimately improve your bottom line.\nOne big part of solving the misclassification issue is having better information on class code exposure by policy. There is a straightforward set of actions you can take that are proven to help carriers get a better handle on this issue and begin to solve it. We\u2019ve condensed these insights into an easy to follow guide, The Punch List: 4 Steps to fix payroll misclassification on your book.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr is the chief brand advocate for Valen Analytics, paving the way for prospective clients to lead the innovation initiatives required to compete in today\u2019s marketplace.

Today, however, there is more insurance tech investment than ever before, but not in a traditional sense that one might expect. Rather, it\u2019s flowing in through companies that are trying to disrupt the industry.\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk saying Lemonade,\u00a0Coverhound, Policy Genius, Everquote, Compare.com and Zenefits won\u2019t succeed, but the playing field is different now for two reasons:\n\nThe Internet is everywhere\nInsurance is not meeting customer expectations\n\nConsider\u00a0Net Promoter Score, which answers the question, \u201cWould you recommend X to a friend/colleague on a scale of 1-10?\u201d With an average industry-wide NPS\u00a0of 28 (out of 100), the fact is we are not living up to customer expectations in insurance.\nThe rise of the Internet has now made it easier for dissatisfied consumers to engage with businesses. No matter the regulatory environment, capital or other challenges, someone will always find a way to satisfy them when they\u2019re not happy, and innovators figure out ways to use technology to go after the incumbent market share with a new way to do business.\nOne carrier that is doing this unusually well for the industry is USAA, with a 2015 Net Promoter Score of 75, a giant leap of 47 points more than the industry average. So what are they doing differently? A lot, as it turns out.\nWhereas insurance has traditionally played it safe in their approach to business (and not surprisingly\u2026it\u2019s the business of insurance to create safety nets), USAA\u2019s mission is to do whatever it takes to benefit the customer. This customer-centric attitude makes innovation a top priority where ideas are vetted with an attitude of \u201cfail fast, fail cheaply.\u201d The carrier is not afraid to invest in new technologies, consider new approaches and test out new partnerships, including the one with Google Compare prior to Google\u2019s announcement that it would be halting operations.\nJon-Michael Kowall, AVP of P&C Innovation, said that USAA was undeterred by Google Compare shutting its doors. In fact, the vast majority of ideas in their innovation incubator fail\u2026but a few hit it big, and those are the gold nuggets they so successfully mine for. Its innovation center, ICE (Innovation Community for the Enterprise), boasts a tree sculpture with leaves that represent the company\u2019s patents, which has over 1,100 for ideas by USAA employees.\nUSAA isn\u2019t the only company insurance carriers should keep their eyes on. As mentioned in Innovator\u2019s Dilemma: A Constant in Every Industry\u2026Even Insurance, rules for established industries are changing. Non-insurance start-ups like Lemonade, Coverhound and Policy Genius are shaking up the industry, and they\u2019re just getting started. With $2.65B in insurance tech investments last year, and a 36% increase in these investments predicted for 2016 according to KPMG, we\u2019ve only seen the tip of the iceberg ahead as more and more companies like Embroker continue to burst onto the scene.\nWhat this means for insurance is simple: The game is changing, and it\u2019s changing fast. Incumbents who prioritize legacy systems over innovation and customer needs are going to lose market share to those both within industry and from outside that are more data-driven and customer-centric. \u201cThis is the way things have always been done\u201d is no longer a sustainable reason to keep doing them that way.\nThe good news for those carriers that are just coming to this realization is that it\u2019s not too late to foster a new culture of innovation within its organization. Knowing where to start can often be a daunting task, however, and a good first step is to know what\u2019s on the horizon.

Even if you\u2019ve been hiding under a rock, it\u2019s almost impossible to avoid hearing about how companies are turning around their results through better modeling or how new competitors like Lemonade and Zenefits are entering into insurance using the power of predictive analytics. It\u2019s difficult to know when to begin, especially when implementation seems like a daunting task.\nSo, when is the best time to adopt predictive analytics and implement a predictive model?\nThe answer is simple: Now. Here\u2019s why:\n\u00a0\nMarket share consolidation is happening.\nWe\u2019ve already seen the personal lines market become consolidated and now commercial lines are following suit. It\u2019s no coincidence that the historically troubled line of workers\u2019 compensation only became profitable for the first time since 2006, while significant shifts in market share appear among the top 10 insurers.\n\nCompanies such as Travelers and Berkshire Hathaway are known to have a well-established holistic analytics strategy driving their businesses and have developed a more targeted and sophisticated customer acquisition strategy in order to locate the best risks and price them competitively.\nAdding to the consolidation issue is the continued growth of mergers and acquisitions on a global scale, with the U.S. showing the most activity at a 61% year-over-year increase. Commercial insurers need to arm themselves with more data so they can compete with companies targeting niche markets and leveraging more granular segmentation of mainstream business.\nHaving the tools needed to compete for this business is crucial to staying ahead of the pack during a tumultuous period of change in the industry.\n\u00a0\nOutside competition is coming into insurance.\nThink you\u2019re only competing against other insurance carriers? Think again. Investment in insurance technology more than tripled from 2014 to 2015, with a whopping $2.6 billion last year. Industry giants like Progressive and USAA are known for their innovation and analytics approaches, but there are new players on the horizon with the likes of Lemonade, Coverhound, Policy Genius, Everquote, Compare.com and Zenefits, just to name a few.\nAll of this innovation comes at a time of immense disruption in response to the overall lack of customer satisfaction with the insurance industry. With an average industry-wide Net Promoter Score of 28 (out of 100), the fact is that we as an industry are not living up to customer expectations. This gap in satisfaction means that competitors who can offer a streamlined, efficient experience can swoop in and show customers what they\u2019ve been searching for.\n\u00a0\nYour internal teams are fighting each other over price.\nPricing has never been more important than it is right now. Thirty years ago, carriers could earn a 16% ROE by simply breaking even on the underwriting side. Now, with lower investment yields and lower leverage, a 100% combined ratio delivers an anemic 3.5% ROE. To make profitability targets, carriers have to be making a profit on the underwriting side. There is no other option.\nHowever, in a recent survey we conducted with over 200 P/C insurance professionals, we found that 77% believe that actuaries and underwriters are at odds over price. Setting prices has traditionally been seen as the domain of the actuary. But, you also need smart risk selection, which is the art of underwriting \u2013 knowing whether to accept the risk under consideration at prices being set by the market. If they\u2019re working in opposite directions, you\u2019re going to go in circles.\n\u00a0\nYour customers are demanding immediacy.\nWith advances in technology, people have become accustomed (and conditioned) to faster and faster responses, which means underwriters are squeezed for time and have to generate quotes much quicker than they used to.\nConsider these examples:\n\nFirstComp conducted an in-depth study of response times to closing workers\u2019 comp business. They found that when an insurer provides a quote to an agent within one hour, the quote-to-bind ratio is 52%. However, if you wait 24 hours, it drops to 30%. Think back 5-10 years. Would anyone have talked about a 20% drop in the quote-to-bind ratio because an agent had to wait just one business day?\nZurich, understanding this trend in customer expectations, cut the time required to give a commercial auto quote on a 100 vehicle fleet from 8 hours to just 15 minutes. That wasn\u2019t their only win here \u2013 now their underwriters can focus on applying their expertise (actually underwriting) instead of spending time gathering and entering data.\n\nBoth of these examples are from 2012, so imagine how much has changed in just 4 years.\n\u00a0\nYour competition is already using predictive models to adversely select against you.\nAdverse selection blindsides many carriers with devastating consequences on their portfolios as early adopters have already started to become much more sophisticated in their pricing. Companies that underwrite and price based on traditional methods are competing against these early adopters. The companies with more sophisticated pricing are able to drive adverse selection by stealing the good risks and leaving the poor risks behind for their competition.\n\u00a0\nSo when is the best time to implement predictive analytics? There\u2019s no time like the present. Carriers today are using advanced data and analytics to gain an advantage, and the number of carriers armed with this kind of insight is increasing in a big way. This is a battlefield in which superior information defines the high ground. Those with access to this information can maintain their strategic position \u2013 defending their place on good risks and refusing to take on new bad risks. Those without it can\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s time to take the first step. Here\u2019s how.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou never change things by fighting the existing reality.\nTo change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\u201d\n\u2013R.

Companies like Airbnb and Uber have moved other industries who have long relied on regulatory protection, captive markets, and capital assets to the backseat of the sharing economy.\nHow does this disruption happen to incumbents who have been in the game for a lifetime or more? It all comes back to one thing.\nConsumers. Always. Win.\nNo matter the regulatory environment, capital or other challenges, innovators will find a way to use technology to satisfy them. It always begins the same way as well: A catalyst, which prompts a new way of thinking, and finally a breakthrough.\n\nTake the Uber origin story, for example. The founders of Uber had trouble hailing a cab in the rain one night (Catalyst), so they thought there must be a better way to find cars in the right place at the right time. Their idea wasn\u2019t originally to try to take over taxi services. Rather, they were originally thinking of a limo-time share service (New Thinking), which was quickly modified to an app for black car ridesharing service (Breakthrough) that the company is known for today\nThis is certainly true in the insurance industry as well as non-insurance companies like Lemonade, Coverhound, Policy Genius, Everquote, Compare.com and Zenefits, who are making breakthroughs every day. And they\u2019re not the only ones. There are currently $2.65B in insurance tech investments, up from virtually nothing twenty years ago.\nAs the Innovator\u2019s Dilemma suggests, innovation is key no matter what industry you work in. Once a company is in a mature industry for some time, it often feels a false sense of security. In this state, it is easy to dismiss small innovations as unnecessary as the company continues to serve the majority of its customers (in insurance, these are either independent agents or policyholders). Meanwhile, an outside competitor flies in under the radar to satisfy a niche market in a completely new way. All of the sudden the traditional company is blindsided, loses significant market share and may go out of business completely.\nIn this age of digital, these disruptors happen more quickly and more often \u2013 some not even requiring expertise in the fields they enter (i.e. Uber, Airbnb). For insurance, this is a very real threat as most insurance companies are slow to innovate and adopt new technologies. So what\u2019s on the horizon for the insurance industry? The 2016 Outlook Report reveals what\u2019s next and how can they leverage innovation within their own organizations to protect themselves against the impeding threat of outside disruption.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr is the chief brand advocate for Valen Analytics, paving the way for prospective clients to lead the innovation initiatives required to compete in today\u2019s marketplace.

They may not realize it, but combining the human experience of an underwriter\u2019s skill and experience with a predictive model built on historical data leads to astounding results.\nAs we noted in a survey of 111 property casualty executives, underwriters are resistant to using predictive analytics. Because of this, Valen conducted a study of a regional P/C insurer to show how powerful it can be when there isn\u2019t a resistance to using analytics in underwriting. The chart below is used to measure lift, which in terms of predictive modeling is how we decide the effectiveness of the model. In short \u2013 the higher the lift, the better the model.\n\nWe started by asking: What predictive power did their underwriters have? (You can do this at your company too.) We see the underwriters\u2019 predictions by looking at what tier they placed a risk in, or how much debit or credit they selected (represented by the green line above).

This improved the overall differential between \u201cbest and worst\u201d \u2013 the best risks are 50% better than average, and the worst are about 75% worse than average.\nFinally, we took the average of the underwriter\u2019s prediction and the model\u2019s prediction, which is represented by the blue line on the graph. It has by far the most lift from 75% better than average, all the way up to 120% worse than average.\nThis study is indicative of results we see consistently \u2013 the combination of human expertise and analytics is the winning combination. Despite underwriters\u2019 fear of predictive analytics, people still remain an insurer\u2019s most valuable asset. Remember that analytics are a tool, and as with most tools, the people controlling them decide its efficacy.\nIn a time when innovation is disrupting every market, especially insurance, it\u2019s best to be well informed and understand where your new and real competition exists. In order to alleviate the pressure from this tech driven competition, it takes more than simply becoming data-driven yourself. To elicit the best results from your predictive modeling, carriers must focus on creating a predictive analytics strategy the whole organization can get behind.\nWant to know what else to focus on in 2016?\nDownload the 2016 P/C Outlook Report now.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nBret Shroyer, FCAS, is an actuary and Solutions Architect for Valen Analytics.

As prices rise in hard markets, carriers increase rates wherever the market will let them. Then when prices fall in soft markets, carriers make the opposite choice and see how low they will let prices go before throwing in the towel and letting a lower-priced competitor take the good business.\nA common misconception about market cycles is they are caused by reactions to changes in loss ratio- when losses start trending up, the market reacts with higher prices. So when the market overreacts and increases prices too much, it results\u00a0in very low loss ratios, increased competition, and prices decreasing into a softening market. But a recent Willis Re study debunks this notion.\nEvery year, Raj Bohra from Willis Re looks at market cycles by line of business. Bohra compiled a graph of past workers\u2019 compensation market cycles, as shown in the image below. In this aggregate view of the work comp industry results, the blue line represents accident year loss ratio and the red line represents price. We see volatility in both, but is price reacting to loss ratio or are movements in loss ratio a result of changes in price?\n\nTake a look at the green line representing the historic loss rate per dollar of payroll. Contrary to the other two lines, this one has been virtually flat since 1995, meaning that on an aggregate basis, there has been no fundamental change in loss rate for the past 20 years. All of this points to one driver: price movement. The industry has caused the cycles itself.\nOf course there will always be shock industry events or shifting trends that will drive price changes, so market cycles will never truly disappear, but they need to be relied on less when making pricing decisions. We see now that market cycles are led by pricing inefficiency, and more carriers are becoming increasingly sophisticated with pricing through the use of predictive analytics, rather than reacting to broader market trends. The result? The sophisticated pricing is putting an end to extreme market cycles.\nWhen carriers know what they insure, they can make rational pricing decisions at the account level regardless of how the larger market is pricing. In a hard market they can accumulate the best new business by correctly offering them quotes below the market price. So when they\u2019re in a soft market, they can shed the worst renewal business to their na\u00efve competitors.\nConsider this:\nWe recently conducted a study of our commercial lines partners\u2019 portfolios. Using their own data and predictive models, we helped them answer two key questions:\n\nWhat\u2019s our potential benefit in using predictive analytics when our competition doesn\u2019t?\nWhat\u2019s our potential vulnerability if the competition uses predictive analytics and we don\u2019t?\n\nThe results were surprising. On average, we found:\n\nCompanies had 9 loss ratio points of potential advantage from using advanced analytics\nCompanies not yet using analytics faced an average vulnerability of nearly 20 points\n\nAs we move into a soft market, how will you respond with this new insight? Will you let the market drive or will you decide where you play in the cycle?\nGet\u00a0the 2016 Outlook Report\nFor\u00a0a Better View of the Road Ahead\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nBret Shroyer, FCAS, is an actuary and Solutions Architect for Valen Analytics.

As a technology and data analytics company, we have a unique perspective to share as insurance faces unprecedented disruption and a real need for innovation.\nAnd so, in the midst of a rapidly changing marketplace with pretty big stakes, we publish a thought provoking report outlining what insurers need to focus on over the next 12 months to remain relevant and competitive. No pressure.\nWhen I started on our first outlook report in 2014, I pulled it together in just a few days. I didn\u2019t really know if anyone would care what we had to say, and wanted to hedge my bets in terms of the time and effort it takes to put something like that together. I was blown away by the hundreds of people who downloaded the report. Then, we held a webinar to go through our recommendations more in-depth with over 150 attendees.\nOk, I thought, we\u2019ll up the stakes in 2015.\nAnd, we did. We were pretty bold in our predictions that big technology companies were going to get much more serious about disrupting insurance; that the market share consolidation already seen in personal lines was coming to commercial lines more quickly than people thought; and that Millennials presented an entirely new paradigm that required insurers to be more transparent and responsive to their needs.\nEver feel that twinge of uncertainty when sending an email with a strong response on something you feel passionate about? Well, multiply that times 100 and you\u2019ll get a sense of what I was feeling as we published the 2015 Outlook Report last fall.\nHow did it work out? Beyond my wildest expectations.\nOn technology disruption. Not only did Google Compare make its entry just a few months later, our Summit keynote speaker Andrew Rose from Compare.com, a Google partner, actually made the breaking news announcement as the press release went live while he was on stage. Never could we have planned that in a million years! You could\u2019ve heard a pin drop in the room. It was the worst kept secret in insurance, of course, but that didn\u2019t matter when it was actually made public. You could almost see the wheels turning in our attendees\u2019 heads\u2026What does this mean for my business? \nOn competitors and market share. This is the area where I most felt we could be out pretty far ahead of our skis. After all, who really knows how long it will take to see more sophisticated competitors that leverage analytics to drive pricing and risk selection decisions start to dominate in the market? Well, we were able to include in our 2016 Outlook Report that in workers\u2019 compensation, market share has shifted dramatically amongst the top 10. It\u2019s a clear signal that this market is changing more quickly than what insurance is used to historically. Big sigh of relief!\nOn Millennials. Investment in insurance tech startups is heating up big time. There\u2019s some real momentum building as technology innovators look to serve the insurance customer in ways that are better, faster and cheaper. That means more transparency during the buying process, more on demand services and applications that make it easy to track your insurance policies, and much more. 2016 should be an interesting year to watch how disruption will play out across the distribution supply chain.\nAt Valen, we love this stuff. We think this is an incredibly exciting time to be in insurance and serve carriers who are staying ahead of the curve. It will be bumpy at times, but in the end, the industry desperately needs to redefine what it means to serve the customer, take more risks and be willing to test, learn and adjust quickly. That\u2019s the reality of modern business.\nWant to know more about our take on the market? Check out our 2016 Outlook Report and keep us honest as the year plays out. Did we get it right?

However, insurance companies today are looking at a more diverse and segmented market than pre-2008, which makes the \u201cold way of doing things\u201d no longer applicable. The insurance industry is increasing in complexity, and with so many insurers successfully implementing predictive analytics, greater precision in underwriting is becoming the \u201cnew normal.\u201d In fact, a recent A.M. Best study shows that P/C insurers are facing more aggressive pricing competition than any other insurance sector.\nBut some carriers forget that implementation of predictive models isn\u2019t one size fits all. \u00a0It requires more than just selecting the right model. Carriers need to follow very specific steps in the process to yield the best results from their investment. The most important first step is to make sure all relevant stakeholders understand the business goals and organizational commitment. The number one cause of failure in predictive modeling initiatives isn\u2019t a technical or data problem, but instead a lack of clarity on the business objective combined with a defect in an implementation plan (or lack thereof). Focus first on securing C-suite support as well as gaining buy-in from the underwriters who will be using the model.\nThe next important step in any predictive analytics implementation is assessing your organization\u2019s resources and capabilities. Regardless of whether the data analytics project will be internally or externally developed, your assessment should be equally rigorous. Attention to the following areas will be crucial:\n\nData Considerations: Do you have adequate data in-house to build a robust predictive model? If not, which external data sources will help you fill in the gaps?\nModeling Best Practices: Whether internal or external, do you have a solid approach to data custody, data partitioning, model validation and choosing the right type of model for your specific application?\nIT Resources: Ensure that the scope is accurately defined, and know when you will be able to implement the model. If time-to-market exceeds 18-24+ months you will lose competitive ground.\nReporting: If it can be measured, it can be managed. Reporting should include success metrics easily available to all stakeholders, along with real-time insights so that your underwriters can make changes to improve risk selection and pricing decisions.\n\nBoiling this down, it\u2019s critical to align a data analytics initiative to a strategic business priority. Once you\u2019ve done that, it will be far easier to garner the time and attention required across the organization. Remember, incorporating predictive analytics isn\u2019t just about technology.

The insurance industry is increasing in complexity, and with so many insurers successfully implementing predictive analytics, greater precision in underwriting is quickly becoming the \u201cnew normal.\u201d In fact, a recent A.M. Best study shows that P/C insurers are facing more aggressive pricing competition than any other insurance sector.\nMany of the insurers who have yet to implement a predictive model, however, aren\u2019t sure what the first steps are to a successful implementation. One of the most crucial areas of focus should be gaining organizational buy-in. The most sophisticated and accurate model will be a wasted investment if the underwriters choose to deviate from the intended use of the model, or worse, ignore it completely. Data analytics can only be successful if developed and deployed in the right environment \u2013 so underwriters need to be on board with the plan of action as much as the C-suite.\nThat being said, given the choice between leading a large-scale change management initiative and getting a root canal, many executives would rather pick up the phone to call the dentist. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Following a thoughtful and straightforward process that involves all stakeholders goes a long way. It\u2019s best to prepare the following:\n\nA solid business case\nPlan for cultural adoption\nClear, straightforward processes\nA way to be transparent and share results (both good and bad)\nTraining and tech support\nWays to adjust \u2013 be open to feedback, evaluate it objectively and make necessary changes\n\nGaining buy-in from the underwriting team requires that they understand why the model is being implemented, what the desired outcomes are, and what their role is in implementing it. But there are still some who rely solely on their own experience and knowledge that may feel threatened by a data-driven underwriting process. In fact, nearly half of the attending carriers at the 2015 Valen Summit cited lack of underwriting adoption as one of the primary risks in a predictive analytics initiative.\nInsurers with the most success in predictive modeling implementation create a specific set of underwriting rules and effectively communicate how predictive analytics are another tool to enhance their performance, rather than something that will replace them entirely. At the same time, it is also important to monitor the implementation of underwriting guidelines, ensuring that they are being followed appropriately.\nOne company that exemplifies these best practices is Farm Bureau Financial Services, which was honored with a Celent Model Insurer Award for their implementation of predictive analytics in underwriting. They ensured success by creating a process that was easy for everyone to understand the output and by implementing it in a consistent manner.\nWhile beginning a predictive analytics journey can be difficult and confusing at first glance, following these best practices will increase your chances of getting it right on the first try and ensuring your business goals will be met.

In fact, at this year\u2019s Valen Analytics Summit, insurance executives reported that many of them were already using predictive analytics for underwriting and the 56% that were not, planned to start within a year. However, many insurers haven\u2019t spent enough energy planning exactly how to implement analytics to get the results they want. While insurers would like predictive analytics to be a one-size-fits-all improvement to their business, it is a custom built tool where the degree of success is determined by the mutual understanding of the benefits and rules surrounding the predictive model and how it works within the specific organization.\nThere are various steps that need attention along the implementation journey, like gaining organizational buy-in and assessing your organization\u2019s capabilities and resources. However, the first step when considering predictive analytics is to secure senior level commitment.\nInformation is a business enabler, and any data analytics project must produce meaningful insights that will solve particular problems and achieve specific objectives. Once you define the problem to solve, make sure that all the relevant stakeholders understand the business goals from the beginning and that you have secured executive commitment or sponsorship.\nNext, the organization must agree up front upon a set of metrics which will measure the success of the implementation. Questions you will need to answer include:\n\nHow will we prove that a predictive model will produce results? What is our proof of concept?\nWhat are the agreed upon metrics to measure success? These include loss ratio, price competitiveness, premium growth?\nWhat management reporting will you put in place? If it can be measured, it can be managed.\nHow do we know if a predictive model is giving us new insights vs. telling us what we already know?\nWhat is our risk appetite for this initiative? What are the assumptions and sensitivities in our model and how will those impact projected results?\nWhat is the plan to integrate the model within our existing workflow?\n\nValen\u2019s recent survey showed that loss ratio was the top issue for underwriting analytics. Whether it\u2019s loss ratio, pricing competitiveness, premium growth or something else, create a baseline so you can show before and after results with your analytics project. Remember to start small and build on early wins; don\u2019t boil the ocean right out of the gate. Pick a portion of your policies or a test group of underwriters and run a limited pilot project. That\u2019s the best way to get something started promptly, prove you have the right process in place and make sure to scale as you see success.\nFinally, consider the risk appetite for any particular initiative. What are the assumptions and sensitivities in your predictive model, and how will those affect projected results?

Consider this:\n\nTowers Watson recently reported that 87% of P&C insurers are seeing profitability with the use of predictive models. As a result, many of their competitors are now being adversely selected, (whether intentionally or not) along with an increasing disparity between carriers with a competitive edge and those without.\nCompanies like Esurance and Progressive have long found success by building their brands by consistently evolving and changing with growing consumer demands. However, now that Google has arrived on the scene, the tech giant\u2019s comparison site will put increased pressure on the rest of the insurance companies that have not been able to meet growing consumer demand. Its arrival will affect the entire industry\u2014from the way they interact with customers, to how they attract new customers and price risk more accurately.\nMillennials currently make up the largest generation in the U.S. Unfortunately for the industry, they also happen to be the demographic most dissatisfied with insurance products and services. They strongly favor companies with easy-to-navigate websites, and they don\u2019t always base decisions on price alone as previous generations were prone to do.\n\nThese topics have been at the forefront of the insurance industry, signaling that the time to innovate is now. But are internal obstacles standing in the way of progress?\nTwo recent polls of P/C executives with 312 responses indicate that there are internal conflicts plaguing insurers that may prevent successful implementation of innovative strategies within an organization. \u00a0The poll found that:\n\n77% believe underwriters & actuaries are at odds over price\n77% believe underwriters are resistant to adopting analytics\n\nOne challenge here is that underwriters and actuaries approach their roles with opposing viewpoints: Actuaries try to contain risk while underwriters are assigned to take on more. What ends up happening is that the actuarial team sets rates only to see them \u201cmessed up\u201d by underwriters bringing in new business. At the same time, underwriters complain that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to write new business with rates that are too high to be competitive in a particular market.\nThe frequently growing adoption of predictive analytics adds a separate challenge because underwriters don\u2019t trust or understand new technology, and are concerned that they will be replaced.\nThat being said, is there something happening on a fundamental level within many insurers that prevents them from fostering and executing innovation in a long-term, sustainable way?\nWe asked ourselves this same question, so we hosted a webinar with Bret Shroyer, FCAS, Solutions Architect at Valen Analytics, where we looked at:\n\nDetails on what\u2019s driving the underwriter-actuary conflict\nClear view inside today\u2019s most successful insurers\nHistorical lessons of insurance innovation: credit score and cat modeling\nHow to address the underwriter resistance issue head on: you can solve this\n\nIf you missed it, you can still\u00a0view the replay here:\u00a0Failure to Innovate: What the Underwriter \u2013 Actuary Conflict Teaches Us.

This is a prime example of the threat \u2013 as well as the advantage \u2013 of data analytics. The carrier who accurately identifies the best 10% of the market will be able to compete on and win this business, while the carrier who can\u2019t will lose out.\nThis is why predictive analytics is rapidly emerging as a must-have tool in the insurance carrier\u2019s arsenal. Predictive analytics can be deployed from the bottom up to look at everything from individual account pricing, new business underwriting triage, audit and inspection optimization, claims management, and incident-level fraud detection. Alternatively, predictive analytics can also be deployed from the top down. Imagine if you could accurately predict your accident-year loss ratio every year by the end of June? Could you improve performance if you were armed with this kind of powerful insight?\nWith embedded profit, a forward-looking view of profitability at the policy level, this type of proactive approach to your book of business is made possible. Embedded profit = collected premium \u2013 (predicted loss + predicted expense), and it offers a number of important advantages:\n\nIt is credible at the policy level.\nIt provides real-time feedback on profitability before policy inception (not 12-24 months later).\nIt doesn\u2019t depend on loss development or IBNR assumptions.\nIt provides a new statistic which is very useful for other applications.\n\nThese applications of predictive analytics, while novel, represent just an introduction to the possibilities. The shift to predictive analytics opens the door to a completely new class of metrics \u2013 real-time and forward-looking \u2013 that can fundamentally change the ways in which an insurance portfolio is managed. Embedded profit is just the tip of the iceberg.\nThat being said, implementing predictive analytics in an underwriting organization is a significant undertaking, which many companies mistakenly equate success to selecting the right predictive model. However, the model is only one part of a larger process. Whether you are developing a model in-house or using an external technology provider, there are components common to every predictive analytics project that are necessary to ensure success.

The industry is coming under fire for using credit information to price personal auto insurance policies. But, as Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute noted in an interview for Bloomberg, \u201cThe fact that insurance-based credit scores are an important part of setting rates is nothing new. It is strongly predictive of loss, and that\u2019s a net benefit to consumers.\u201d\nHartwig is making the important point that it\u2019s an insurer\u2019s job to use proven, credible ways to identify which policyholders are more or less risky and charge accordingly. The entire notion of shared risk requires insurers to make these determinations with the best information available. Who among us would take on the liability of owning a car, a home, or starting a business if we didn\u2019t have the insurance safety net? One bad car accident could wipe us out financially.\nI could go on defending insurance and listing the multitudes of other industries that use similar information to assess, segment and target their customers. But that would be missing the point. In today\u2019s information-at-your-fingertips world, insurers have lagged behind in terms of modernizing their customer experience \u2013 which includes a healthy, if uncomfortable dose, of transparency.\nGone are the days when a company controls the information a customer has about their products, pricing, and service record. The reality is that how you run your business, price your products, and treat your customers is publicly available 24/7. Granted the information consumers post online isn\u2019t always accurate, but insurance could do a much better job at building consumer relationships. According to an Ernst & Young study, consumer trust for insurance companies is lower than other industries, with 57% of consumers reporting dissatisfaction with the lack of interaction and proactive communication from insurers.\nIf insurers aren\u2019t having conversations and engaging their customers, then the industry is letting its reputation be defined by others, and studies show that your customers are more likely to share a bad experience than a good one. Investigations, like the one from Consumer Reports, are much more likely to target those industries that don\u2019t engender consumer trust. There\u2019s nothing fundamentally wrong about auto insurers having tested all types of information to find what is most predictive of loss. It\u2019s not dissimilar to how online retailers collect our information as we surf the web to serve up relevant products and offers, or apps that track our behavior at increasing rates. Insurers have an opportunity to step up efforts to create a real dialogue with consumers in order to start building trust. If they don\u2019t, they will continue to be an easy target for criticism and complaints.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr is the chief brand advocate for Valen Analytics, paving the way for prospective clients to lead the innovation initiatives required to compete in today\u2019s marketplace.

Take our 1-question poll\u00a0on the cause of friction between underwriters and actuaries.\nThis friction is understandable given the fundamental difference in viewpoints between the two:\n\nThe actuary is typically focused on controlling the downside, while the underwriter is typically focused on maximizing the upside.\nActuaries are try to contain risk, while underwriters are actually assigned the job of taking on more.\nActuaries ask \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d while underwriters contemplate \u201cHow great could this account be for us?\u201d\n\nBring the Peace\nHere are a few tips to help bring the two sides together. After all, both functions are critical to the success of any insurance company, and everyone wins when these two groups are working together collaboratively.\nActuary Gripe: Underwriters aren\u2019t following the pricing guidelines\nUnderwriter Response: \u201cSometimes underwriters have risk information that doesn\u2019t match up with the rate plan. Can we add this as a rating element or include it in our discretionary pricing schedule?\u201d\nActuary Gripe: Underwriters care more about meeting their production goals than they do about risk quality.\nUnderwriter Response: \u201cWe can manage what we can measure. If the goal is production, we\u2019ll increase production. If the goal is good quality business, help us identify that business and we\u2019ll target it.\u201d\nUnderwriter Gripe: Agents don\u2019t like to work with us; we ask for too much information.\nActuary Response: Initial information helps qualify a risk through underwriting, and additional info is needed to offer a quote. If we help the agents understand what information is needed at what time, we can lessen the burden up front to improve the working relationship.\nUnderwriter Gripe: I don\u2019t have enough pricing flexibility.\nActuary Response: The rate plan will never be able to replace underwriting expertise.\u00a0 You can identify risks that are better than manual \u2013 go ahead and be competitive. But that means you\u2019ll also have to be debiting the worse than average risks, or we we\u2019ll wind up going over our loss ratio target.\nIf you\u2019d like more information on how actuaries and underwriters can overcome common obstacles, fill out our 1-question poll. We\u2019ll share the results and more tips.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKirstin Marr is the chief brand advocate for Valen Analytics, paving the way for prospective clients to lead the innovation initiatives required to compete in today\u2019s marketplace.

These are the steps we see on a very regular basis:\n\nPut in place a 10% rate increase. (After which loss ratio actually deteriorates.)\nFind a poor-performing class or region and exit that business. (Volume drops, but results don\u2019t materially improve.)\nResort to predictive analytics to find an answer.\n\nIn reality, these efforts should have started with the third step above and moved forward from there. Beginning with predictive analytics, the carrier can identify the policies or groups of policies that are performing better or worse than expected. This almost never results in the conclusion that barbers (sorry, I had to pick on someone) should be non-renewed, or that the carrier simply needs to stop writing in Allenstown. Instead, it points to the policies in each of those groups that are predicted to be trouble as well as identifies the policies in those groups that are predicted to be profitable.\nFarm Bureau Financial Services, which writes workers compensation coverage, is one of the exceptions to this rule. In 2012, they were in some trouble so they quickly implemented predictive analytics into their BOP commercial lines to improve underwriting profitability and turn the ship around. As a result, they not only reduced their loss ratio by 66% from 2012 to 2014, they also grew their premium by 22.4% in 2013 and 10.1% in 2014.\nAs Farm Bureau learned, there\u2019s something surprising that happens when you start looking at predictive statistics on an in-force book. The model doesn\u2019t have pre-conceived notions about which regions or classes are in or out of favor. As a result, within the worst-performing class, the model might find that 25% of the policies are significantly better than average, and should be retained. Conversely, within the best-performing class, the model might find that 25% are significantly worse than average, and should be cut.\nThis is how carriers experience significant wins when implementing predictive analytics for the first time. They discover many opportunities to make significant improvements in risk selection and pricing on the in-force book, and for the first time they can actually see and measure the impact of adverse selection on their book in recent years. There are so many opportunities to gather this low hanging fruit that it\u2019s hard to choose a bad place to start once you have a reliable model in place.\nAs a result, the preferred order of operations becomes:\n\nImplement predictive analytics to look at prospective profitability at the policy level.\nUse that information to drive risk selection and pricing at the policy level. This will result in non-renewing or losing some segments, and growing other segments. These segments emerge organically, from the bottom up, rather than as a general strategy from the top down.\nAfter re-underwriting and re-pricing the book, adjust base rate level for portfolio profitability target.\n\nThe final result is a portfolio comprising risks that you want to write, at adequate prices. It may even include some Allenstown barbers.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nBret Shroyer, FCAS, is an actuary and Solutions Architect for Valen Analytics.

Top performing carriers and tech companies have one thing in common: They win profitable market share through data-driven decision-making. Tech is becoming a mainstay in the industry\u2014and that means an exponential increase in the need for tech talent.\n50% of the insurance workforce is set to retire in the next ten years, and the industry will have 400,000 positions to fill by 2020. As Baby Boomers move into the next phase of their life, we need Millennials to step up to the plate to fill their shoes. The bad news is, they\u2019re not.\n80% of Millennials report having limited knowledge and understanding of the employment opportunities available within the insurance industry. In addition to that, Millennials think working in the insurance industry is, frankly, boring. College freshmen aren\u2019t necessarily dreaming of a career as a \u201cData Analyst\u201d when they graduate. Now put \u201cInsurance Data Analyst\u201d up as a career choice and, and we\u2019re even lower on the list. If we\u2019re going to attract the right data talent in the coming decade, the insurance industry has to do something to make this stuff look sexy, starting right now.\nIt\u2019s no longer enough to simply provide stable job opportunities; it is crucial to find a way to make insurance relevant to a new breed of employees. More diverse than ever before, the next generation of workers differs with regards to age, gender, cultural backgrounds, skill sets and working styles. Studies have proven that they crave innovation, independence and flexibility, gravitating toward companies like Google and Facebook that have built empires around those same principles.\nThat being said, what changes need to be made in order to accommodate the highly connected, diverse and tech-savvy millennial generation? The answer lies in utilizing technology such as big data and analytics to help bring insurance into the 21st century. Even more importantly, there is an opportunity for tech-minded talent to help make the industry more nimble, efficient and able to create an engaging customer experience that allows insurers to attract and retain the best risks. Leading insurers are creating sustainable underwriting profits by leveraging data analytics, and the timing couldn\u2019t be better to match technology solutions with human capital that knows how to leverage it.\nInsurance is playing catch-up in convincing the brightest talent that this is an industry ripe for innovation, especially as it pertains to the millennial generation. While insurance may not have been \u201ccool\u201d for some time, there are ways to make it an attractive option by focusing on what the diverse millennial generation wants and needs\u2014the ability to innovate and use technology to improve people\u2019s daily lives.\nIn a joint survey conducted by the Business Roundtable (BRT) and Change the Equation (CTEq) of their member CEOs, respondents offered several solutions to address the talent gap:\n\n70% found internships to be a useful mechanism to help ensure that employees were immediately productive.\n54% said that assisting educational institutions with curriculum development would improve productivity.\n37% thought apprenticeship programs held real promise.\n21% recommended assisting education institutions with classroom instruction.\n\nGiven the talent pool is scarce and competition is fierce, insurance companies will need to step into this century to draw in talent more quickly. The first step is to band together and recognize that by collaborating as an industry, we can tell a compelling story about the growing opportunities available, appeal to the millennial generation, and quash this talent crisis.\nTell us what you think!\nAre your underwriters excited about innovation?\nTake our 1 question poll now.\n ", "title": "Bringing Insurance into the 21st Century", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.2030399449035813, "subjectivity": 0.45241164895710356}, "predictive-analytics-implementation-steps": {"content": "\nThere is a common misconception in insurance that competitive advantage is won by simply picking the right predictive model. However, the model itself is just a small part of a much larger process that touches nearly every part of the insurance organization. Embracing predictive analytics is like recruiting a star quarterback; alone he\u2019s not enough to guarantee a win. He requires both a solid team and a good playbook to achieve his full potential.\nGet the full organizational readiness checklist here\nThat being said, here\u2019s a list of 4 key steps that are imperative to ensuring your predictive analytics implementation is a success throughout your organization:\nAlignment of People\nThe most important first step in predictive modeling is making sure all relevant stakeholders understand the business goals and organizational commitment. The number one cause of failure in predictive modeling initiatives isn\u2019t a technical or data problem, but instead a lack of clarity on the business objective combined with a defect in the implementation plan (or lack thereof).\nSenior level commitment and organizational buy-in are both key here. Decide on metrics that management will use to measure the impact of the model, what problems you are trying to solve and how you will define success. You must also ask yourself: If we lead, will they follow? Data analytics can only be developed and deployed in the right environment. You have to retool your people so that underwriters don\u2019t feel that data analytics are a threat to their expertise, or actuaries to their tried-and-true pricing models.\nResource Assessment\nA predictive analytics engagement is done in-house or by a consultant or built and hosted by a modeling firm. Regardless of whether the data analytics project will be internally or externally developed, your assessment should be equally as rigorous. It\u2019s critical to consider:\n\nData resources: Do you have enough in-house or will you need external sources to help you fill in the gaps?\nModeling best practices: Whether internal or external, do you have a solid approach to data custody, data partitioning, model validation and choosing the right type of model for your specific application?\nIT resources: Ensure that scope is accurately defined and know when you will be able to implement the model. If you are swamped by an IT backlog of 18-24 months, you will lose competitive ground.\nReporting: If it can be measured, it can be managed. Reporting should include success metrics easily available to all stakeholders, along with real-time insights so that your underwriters can make changes to improve risk selection and pricing decisions.\n\nPredictive Model Implementation\nUnless you\u2019re lucky enough to work with an entire group of like-minded individuals, this step must be taken with all players involved, including underwriting, actuarial, training and executive roles. Once you\u2019ve identified the business case and produced the model and implementation plan, make sure all expected results are matched up with the planned deliverables. Once everything is up and running, it is imperative to monitor the adoption in real-time to ensure that the results are matching the initial model goals put in place.\nUnderwriter Training\nA very important but often overlooked step is making sure that underwriters understand why the model is being implemented, what the desired outcomes are and what their role is in implementing it. If the information is presented correctly, underwriters understand that predictive modeling is a tool that can improve their pricing and risk selection as opposed to undermining the underwriters. But there are still some who rely solely on their own experience and knowledge who may feel threatened by a data-driven underwriting process. In fact, nearly half of the attending carriers at the 2015 Valen Summit cited lack of underwriting adoption as one of the primary risks in a predictive analytics initiative.\nBoiling this down, what\u2019s critical is that you align a data analytics initiative to a strategic business priority. Once you do that, it will be far easier to garner the time and attention required across the organization. Remember, incorporating predictive analytics isn\u2019t just about technology. Success is heavily dependent on people and process.\nWant to know what other questions you should be asking?\nGet your checklist now\n ", "title": "Predictive Analytics Alone Won\u2019t Cut It", "author": "\nBy Bret Shroyer, FCAS\n", "polarity": 0.16469815248503775, "subjectivity": 0.48010668748373675}, "how-predictive-analytics-combats-adverse-selection": {"content": "\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t using analytics to increase your efficiency, cut waste and make better business decisions, you are in danger of being left behind.\u201d \u2013 Bernard Marr\n\u00a0\nThis could not be truer, especially in the insurance world where adverse selection is blindsiding many carriers with devastating effects on their portfolios. Those that have predictive analytics, on the other hand, are able to locate and price the best risks at more desirable rates while avoiding poor performing risks at insufficient prices. The carriers not leveraging data analytics are then left with poorly performing accounts while their best business is taken from them, often without even realizing it until it\u2019s too late.\nIf you don\u2019t know where you stand, you\u2019re already a victim. So how do you know if you are a victim of adverse selection, and what can you do about it to protect your book? There are three indicators that should raise red flags that you are in the danger zone.\nThe first is \u2018climbing loss ratios and loss costs\u2019. If a carrier frequently blames market conditions and the irrational pricing of risk by competitors, it could be an early warning sign that the competition has better data to accurately price a specific risk.\nThe second is if a carrier\u2019s rates go up while their volume declines. When raising rates puts policy retention at risk but maintaining the same rates cuts into profitability, their business is stuck in a losing situation if an actuary finds that manual rates aren\u2019t able to cover the expected future cost.\nThe third is when a carrier has inadequate reserves. When actuaries show signs of mild reserve inadequacy, the claims department often argues that while reserving practices are the same, loss frequency and severity have increased. This forces insurers to downsize and focus on a niche specialization in order to survive, while also diminishing possible future growth \u2013 a very precarious situation for any insurer to be in. The fundamental problem with this is that the insurer cannot identify and price risk with the accuracy that their competitors can.\nIf any of these sound familiar, you are likely being adversely selected against by carriers utilizing data analytics. Your book may be quietly suffering, but you can turn it around.\nIn a recent Towers Watson survey, more than half the participants using predictive modeling said it helped with policy retention, and 87 percent reported seeing profitability with the use of their models. These carriers realize early, significant wins when focused on the following three areas at the outset of a predictive modeling implementation:\n\nImproved results: Find the specific problem accounts, and increase price adequacy or drop the risk.\nProfitable growth: Be more competitive on the better risks and win more of the good business being submitted.\nUnderwriting consistency: Understand what\u2019s in the book, and build underwriting processes to standardize risk selection and pricing strategies.\n\nCarriers today are using advanced data and analytics to gain an advantage. Superior information defines the high ground. Those with access to this information can maintain their strategic position, defending their place on good risks and refusing to take on new bad risks. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the carriers without access to this information that will prove to be the casualties in this fight.\nWhich side will you be on?\nphoto credit: MFer04 via photopin (license)\n ", "title": "Think Competitors\u2019 Pricing is Crazy?

Insurers have held on to tradition, but with Millennials and tech giants officially marking their arrival on the scene, they can resist change no longer. The big question is: Will they adapt and innovate or will they lose relevance with their customers like other companies did that resisted change in the face of technology industry transformations (i.e., Blockbuster vs Netflix, or credit card lenders in the 80\u2019s vs. Capital One)?\nGoogle, Facebook, Amazon and Overstock (among others) are all developing insurance offerings. They clearly see opportunities to create efficiencies and make a profit by leveraging the immense data they have about their customers. Their business models are centered on collecting data and analyzing customer-buying patterns in order to create the best customer experience \u2013 which means delivering a better and faster service at a lower price.\nInsurers like Progressive, Geico and State Farm are already playing in the digital arena and have a head start compared to mid-sized and small insurers because they understand how the online game is played. In fact, Progressive\u2019s CIO has suggested they are so far ahead of smaller carriers that those carriers \u201cmight as well give up.\u201d While a bit harsh, there\u2019s no question that new entrants coming into the insurance industry bring with them even greater competition for a customer base that is rapidly changing.\nAt the forefront of customers willing to jump ship are Millennials, who have surpassed the Baby Boomers to become the largest population in the country at 76.6 million strong. According to a recent survey by Capgemini, North American consumer satisfaction with insurance decreased by 8.3% in 2014, which is no coincidence considering the fact that Millennials are the demographic most dissatisfied with insurance products and services. If insurance doesn\u2019t take extra steps to innovate and entice this generation, Millennials will more than likely gravitate toward a well-known tech company that already understands what they are searching for and what they are buying.\nThese should be taken as warning bells, and there are solid ways to adapt, defend and grow your company:\n\nKnowing what you insure. If you\u2019re going to stay ahead of big trends and maintain profitable margins, you have to be better at selecting risks that fit your business and price them accordingly.\nUsing data analytics to evaluate options, which allows you to test and learn, select the best approach, and deliver results that make the greatest strategic impact.\nAccelerating the journey to become a data-driven decision organization. There are a handful of insurers using predictive analytics in specific areas of their business, but insurers that aren\u2019t overhauling organizational culture to think with a data-driven mindset are already behind.\n\nThe future is now, so it is no longer acceptable to continue doing \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d simply because it\u2019s the easy answer. These new entrants are data-driven and tech savvy, and they understand how to deliver a modern consumer experience that will attract the largest generation in the U.S. There is a silver lining though. Google\u2019s entrance to insurance has signaled that innovation and evolution is arriving. These are exciting times, and the companies that will thrive are those that will embrace the opportunity to reinvent how to serve and engage their customers.\nphoto credit: via photopin (license)\n ", "title": "The Future of Insurance Is Now", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.13449741315594974, "subjectivity": 0.4660463520219617}, "predictive-analytics-is-not-a-magic-bullet": {"content": "\nPredictive analytics is a very powerful tool;

This will result in non-renewing or losing some segments, and growing other segments.\u00a0 These segments emerge organically, from the bottom up, rather than as a general strategy from the top down.\nAfter re-underwriting and re-pricing the book, adjust base rate level for portfolio profitability target.\n\nThe final result is a portfolio comprising risks that you want to write, at adequate prices.\u00a0 It may even include some River City hairdressers.\nFailure: Believing That Predictive Analytics Will Save Us\nThe final big point of failure is reliance on predictive analytics as a magic bullet.\u00a0 It\u2019s not.\u00a0 It\u2019s merely a tool \u2013 albeit a very powerful one.\u00a0 Let us not forget the immortal words of Spider-Man: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\u00a0 Insurers investing the time and expense of implementing predictive analytics should feel the responsibility to put in place the support systems needed to extract maximum value from the models.\nPredictive models deliver a steady stream of data that can (and should) help to steer the portfolio.\u00a0 By utilizing these prospective statistics, underwriters can see in real time the impact of their risk selection and pricing decisions on future profitability \u2013 but only if they have the BI tools in place to give them this feedback.\u00a0 If an insurer implements predictive analytics without also executing a system of measurement and monitoring, they\u2019re only seeing half of the story.\nWe already have a well-established feedback loop in insurance: analyze loss ratio, assess performance, and adjust.\u00a0 The big problem here is that the loss ratio statistic is often lagged six months to a year (or more) after the underwriting actions were taken.\u00a0 Predictive statistics, on the other hand, can give us information on our risk selection and pricing performance up to a month in advance of the policy inception date.\u00a0 This allows carriers to take corrective action if they aren\u2019t getting immediate value from a predictive model implementation.\nAvoid Failure\nSo you\u2019re on the road to implementing predictive analytics and want to avoid some of the most common points of failure?\u00a0 Here\u2019s the big three from this article:\n\nCast the predictive analytics net as far and wide as possible given the data available.\nLet analytics drive tactical priorities, not the other way around.\nDon\u2019t just implement analytics.

We need to know why.\nFor decades, insurers have measured performance using a standard set of statistics:\n\nLoss ratio\nCombined ratio\nRate change\nFrequency and severity of loss\nHit ratio\nPremium volume\n\nThese statistics have several things in common. \u00a0First, they are all measures of past performance. \u00a0Second (and most importantly), they answer what happened, but they are all very poor at telling us\u00a0why\u00a0it happened.\nLet\u2019s take loss ratio, for example. \u00a0(I love to pick on loss ratio.) \u00a0We may determine we wrote to a 70% loss ratio this year, and a 75% loss ratio last year. \u00a0Why? \u00a0There are three distinct options:\n\nIt\u2019s what the market gave us, our agents sent us better new business, or benefit schedules changed, resulting in lower average severity.\nIt\u2019s what we did in risk selection or pricing. \u00a0We were better at finding good risks, or losing bad risks, or we just increased rate, leaving risk quality static.\nDumb luck. \u00a0Last year we had a couple of big claims, and this year, we haven\u2019t\u2026yet.\n\nThis is a classic problem for the C-Suite management. \u00a0How can you build strategy if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s really driving current results \u2013 and therefore don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to have an impact in the future?\n\u00a0\nUse Predictive Statistics to Find Out \u201cWhy\u201d\nLuckily, there is a solution to this problem. \u00a0There are statistics that give a laser focus to the drivers, and answer the difficult \u201cWhy\u201d questions.\nThese two statistics, borne out of predictive analytics, point to the answer:\n\nPredicted Risk Quality\nPredicted Loss Ratio Relativity\n\nPredicted Risk Quality, expressed as a relativity to starting value, shows changes in risk quality over time.\u00a0 This is a primary output of a predictive model and shows us whether the inforce book is increasing or decreasing in quality over time.\u00a0 This is an important statistic and should marry with the carrier\u2019s strategy.\nIf the carrier is using predictive analytics to target the worst account for rate increases or non-renewal, you should see risk quality increasing over time, as we expect the mix to be shifting toward better risks.\n\u00a0\nPredicted Risk Quality\nIf the company is seeing average risk quality worsen over time (as shown in this graph) we might suspect that adverse selection is at work.\u00a0 This graph shows that the policies incepting this month have 10% higher loss potential than the baseline portfolio at 1/1/2013.\n\n\u00a0\nPredicted Loss Ratio Relativity\nThe second statistic, Loss Ratio Relativity, is again a prospective measure giving us the expected loss ratio on these newly incepting policies vs. the baseline loss ratio.\u00a0 This measure incorporates (and in fact requires) the calculation of Risk Score \u2013 but includes price information as well.\u00a0 In other words, predicted Loss Ratio Relativity tells us how the underwriters have reacted to the Risk Quality prediction.\n\n\u00a0\nPutting Them Together (It\u2019s OK to Cross the Streams)\nThe final graph illustrates combining these two statistics to identify a successful predictive analytics implementation.\u00a0 Loss Ratio Relativity is decreasing, so results are improving.\u00a0 However, Average Risk Quality is relatively unchanged, which indicates that the carrier is probably pricing better to risk, particularly on high-risk accounts.\nA more accurate pricing and risk selection model allows this carrier to expand its underwriting box with assurance that they can get price right.\u00a0 They\u2019re losing some high-risk accounts to the market, but are keeping the portfolio in balance. \u00a0Loss ratio is improving, but not because the risks are getting better; rather, because the risks are more accurately priced.\n\nThese two trends \u2013 Risk Quality and Loss Ratio Relativity \u2013 combine to reveal the effectiveness of a carrier\u2019s predictive modeling efforts.\u00a0 By evaluating predictive statistics, we can finally start answering the hardest question in predictive analytics: \u201cAre my models actually delivering value to justify the investment?\u201d\nphoto credit: .sarahwynne. via photopin cc\n ", "title": "Two Predictive Statistics You Need to Evaluate Your Model", "author": "\nBy Bret Shroyer, FCAS\n", "polarity": 0.1129093455564044, "subjectivity": 0.46361121721415827}, "3-lessons-insurance-customers-taught-us": {"content": "\nThe Best Lessons Come from Your Customers\nThe marketplaces we compete in are relentless and unforgiving. We all want to grow our businesses, win against the competition, and provide value for our customers and shareholders. For those of us that have been at this awhile, we have to keep our eye on the competitors we know well and an even keener eye on the up and comers out to prove they have a better way of doing things.\nAt the 2014 TechCrunch Disrupt, legendary billionaire investor Mark Cuban summed it up pretty well. \u00a0\u201cThere is no sport as competitive as business\u2026It\u2019s 24 by 7 by 365 by forever, and there are all these young kids out here [gesturing to the live audience in attendance] trying to kick your ass.\u201d\nOftentimes, it\u2019s our customers that provide the best perspective on what really matters about what we do for them. I\u2019m not talking about the nitty gritty detail of product features and benefits, but rather the bigger picture of how technology inventors make the lives of our customers easier to achieve important goals.\nThe lessons shared below are incredibly valuable for any technology company. Recognizing how our technologies interact with and impact people is key. And, even more importantly, it behooves all of us to take a step back and realize that when customers choose to implement our solutions, they are signing up for a much bigger job to make the effort successful for their employees, customers and shareholders. It\u2019s our job to be at their side for the whole journey.\n\u00a0\nEvery Decision Counts \nHawaii Employers\u2019 Mutual Insurance Company (HEMIC) knew they had to provide a way for their underwriters to focus their time on more complex accounts that require their expertise, and overcome the old-school mentality of needing to look at every account. That\u2019s easier said than done, and resistance to change is natural.\nHowever, HEMIC was appropriately reacting to an increasingly competitive market in commercial insurance, and keeping up in today\u2019s environment means capitalizing on technology to increase underwriting efficiency, improve pricing precision, and provide decision support. \u201cIt took time to gain comfort with the system,\u201d said Regina Harris, VP of Underwriting. \u201cIt was a cultural shift, but we\u2019ve made that shift.\u201d\nChange creates friction and unforeseen implications. In the short run, it\u2019s easier to maintain the status quo, and it takes a steadfast determination to evolve your organization to adopt new technologies and new ways of doing things.\n\u00a0\nYour Employees Will Do the Right Thing\nFarm Bureau Financial Services, a regional P&C insurer, had significant loss ratio issues in their workers\u2019 compensation division. Even though they had been using analytics in other areas of the company for many years, they hadn\u2019t adopted it for workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Like HEMIC, they recognized the change wasn\u2019t going to be easy for their underwriters and they needed a way to support the transition to data-driven decision making.\nSteve Wittmuss, commercial lines VP for Farm Bureau put it this way, \u201cI can\u2019t say \u2018start underwriting work comp\u2019 and expect them to know what to do. They\u2019d either have avoided it or pretended to know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nThe leadership at Farm Bureau was very thoughtful in their communication and respect for their underwriters\u2019 experience. \u201cSome of our people have been underwriting for a long time. If you\u2019re not careful, they think you\u2019re challenging their knowledge,\u201d Wittmuss adds. \u201cWe still give them a band they can write that business in. They have a lot of ability to do stuff they need to do to bring the business on.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s paying off. Wittmuss notes that even when the underwriting staff receives complaints from customers who have rate increases, \u201cMany people, when we\u2019ve tried to increase the rates, go out shopping and then they stay with us. That tells me that we were underpriced and that other companies are using predictive modeling. If we didn\u2019t do this, we\u2019d be at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d\n\u00a0\nInvest in Your Customers\u2019 Success\nSociety Insurance, which just celebrated 100 years in business, serves small business owners. Before adopting predictive analytics, Society relied on its underwriters to differentiate risk. Like HEMIC and Farm Bureau, Society\u2019s underwriters were concerned that this new technology would limit their decision making authority and create friction with their agents, who they rely on to bring in new business.\n\u201cWe really specialize in trying to get to small customers,\u201d explains Dominic Weber, VP and actuary at Society. So they focused on how analytics would help them identify key ways to make their businesses more successful, including \u201cbetter claims handling, accurate pricing upfront, and better understanding of how to market services and audit [policies].\u201d\nTo address the concerns of his underwriters and agents, Weber emphasized the need for clear communication and keeping a focus on the customer. \u201cBecause of Society\u2019s background as a mutual insurance company, we are invested in our customers for the long term\u2026Everyone has to buy into the fact that the model is going to give them good information about the policyholder,\u201d he explains of the cultural shift. \u201cIt was a big educational process. The solution was not taking away authority, it was going to give more guidance.\u201d\nphoto credit: toddwendy via photopin cc\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the increasingly rapid adoption of data and analytics at the\n2015 Valen Summit: The Gold Rush!\n ", "title": "3 Lessons Our Customers Taught Us", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.2823572781385282, "subjectivity": 0.5098265016233765}, "big-data-in-insurance-a-glimpse-into-2015": {"content": "\nBernard Marr is one of the big voices to pay attention to on the subject of Big Data.\u00a0 His recent piece \u201cBig Data: The Predictions for 2015\u201d is bold and thought provoking.\u00a0 That is, it got me to thinking.\u00a0 As a P&C actuary, I tend to look at everything through my insurance-colored glasses.\u00a0 So of course, I immediately started thinking about the impact on insurance if Mr. Marr\u2019s predictions come to pass this year.\nAs I share my thoughts below, be aware that the section headers are taken from his article; the rest of the content are my thoughts and interpretations of the impact to the insurance industry.\nThe value of the big data economy will reach $125 billion\nThat\u2019s a really big number, Mr. Marr.\u00a0 I think I know how to answer my son the next time he comes to me looking for advice on a college major.\u00a0 (More on that below, as well.)\nBut what does this huge number mean for insurance?\u00a0 There\u2019s a potential time bomb here for Commercial Lines because this $125 billion means we\u2019re going to see new commerce (and new risks) that are not currently reflected in loss history \u2013 and therefore not reflected in rates.\nMaybe premiums will go up as exposures increase with the new commerce \u2013 but that begs a new question: What\u2019s the right exposure base for aggregating and analyzing big data?\u00a0 Is it revenues?\u00a0 Data observation count?\u00a0 Megaflops?\u00a0 We don\u2019t know the answer to this yet.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it\u2019s not until we start seeing losses that we\u2019ll know for sure.\nThe Internet of Things will go mainstream\nWe already have some limited integration of \u201cThe Internet of Things\u201d into our insurance world.\u00a0 Witness UBI (Usage-Based Insurance) which can tie auto insurance premiums to not only miles driven, but also driving quality.\nGoogle\u2019s Nest thermostat keeps track of when you\u2019re home and away, whether you\u2019re heating or cooling, and communicates this information back to a data store.\u00a0 Could that data be used in more accurate Homeowners pricing?\u00a0 If so, it would be like UBI for the house.\nThe Internet of Things can extend to healthcare and medical insurance as well.\u00a0 We already have health plans offering a discount for attending the gym 12 times per month.\u00a0 We all have \u201ca friend\u201d that sometimes \u201cchecks in\u201d at the gym to meet the quota and get the discount.\u00a0 With the proliferation of worn biometric devices (FitBit, Nike Fuel, and so on) it would be trivial for the carrier to offer a UBI discount based on the quantity and quality of the workout.\u00a0 Of course, they\u2019d need to get the policyholder\u2019s permission to use that data, but if the discount is big enough, we\u2019ll buy it.\nMachines will get better at making decisions\nAs I talk with carriers about predictive analytics, this concept is one of the most disruptive to underwriters and actuaries.\u00a0 There is a fundamental distrust that the model is going to replace them.\nMachines are getting better at making decisions, but within most of insurance, and certainly within commercial lines, the machines should be seen as an enabling technology that helps the underwriter to make better decisions, or the actuary to make more accurate rates.\u00a0 Expert systems can do well on risks that fit neatly into a standard underwriting box, but anything outside of that box is going to need some human intervention.\nTextual analysis will become more widely used\nA recurring theme I hear in talking to carriers is a desire to do claims analysis, fraud detection, or claims triage using textual analysis present in the claims adjusters\u2019 files.\u00a0 There are early adopters in the industry doing this, and there have emerged several consultants and vendors offering bespoke solutions.\u00a0 I think that 2015 could be the year that we see some standardized \u201coff the shelf\u201d solutions emerge that offer claims predictive analytics using textual analysis.\nData visualization tools will dominate the market\nThis is spot-on in insurance, too.\u00a0 Data visualization and exploration tools are emerging quickly in the insurance space.\u00a0 The lines between \u201creporting tool\u201d and \u201cdata analysis tool\u201d are blurring.\u00a0 Companies are realizing that they can combine Key Performance Indicators and metrics from multiple data streams into single dashboard views.\u00a0 This leads to insights that were never before possible using single dimension, standard reporting.\nThere is so much data present in so many dimensions that it no longer makes sense to look at a fixed set of static exhibits when managing insurance operations.\u00a0 Good performance metrics don\u2019t necessarily lead to answers, but instead to better questions \u2013 and answering these new questions demands a dynamic data visualization environment.\nMatt Mosher, SVP Rating Services at A.M.

Yes, insurance is on the precipice of massive change, and it\u2019s not farfetched to see the potential benefits for both industry and consumers. I\u2019m sure there will be disbelievers. After all, insurance gets its fair share of criticism \u2013 some deserved and some shortsighted. It is true that insurance has fallen short in keeping up with today\u2019s customer needs. However, that\u2019s evolving as more insurance companies are stepping up to face what is arguably the most rapid, large-scale change in its history.\nWhen the economy went into a downward spiral, the impact to the property and casualty insurance industry was profound. Many people will be surprised to learn that the premiums insurance companies charge don\u2019t cover the claims and related expenses that are incurred. What that means is that the insurance industry overall loses money on its core business \u2013 writing insurance policies. Where insurance companies have made substantial profits is on the investment income made by using insurance premiums to make lucrative long-term investments. But all that changed in 2008.\nFor an industry that\u2019s been around for over 100 years, making fundamental changes to how it operates and makes a profit is no small feat, and it\u2019s in our collective interest to have a financially sound insurance industry. Imagine getting a loan for a car, a home or a small business without the safety net of property and casualty insurance. We\u2019d be financially devastated if our home burned down or we were involved in a serious car accident without insurance coverage.\nThat said, we need the insurance industry to reinvent itself, thrive in a new economic environment, and adapt to the digital revolution. To that end, these three examples of how the insurance industry is stepping up deserve a shout-out.\n#1: Work Comp Insurers Deliver \nLeading the commercial insurance industry, workers\u2019 compensation carriers are running more profitable underwriting operations. Even with rising medical costs and inherent uncertainty about the risks they insure, work comp insurers have made remarkable progress toward profitability.\nInsurers measure profit by looking at two numbers \u2013 loss ratio (losses/premium) and expense ratio (cost of doing of business) \u2013 that add up to their combined ratio. If an insurer\u2019s combined ratio is 100, they are break-even. If the combined ratio is over 100 percent, the company is running at an underwriting loss and every point below 100 measures the underwriting profit. With a 14% gain toward profitability in just 2 years, workers\u2019 compensation carriers are definitive leaders who have successfully lowered the average combined ratio from 115 in 2011 to 101 in 2013. The final numbers for 2014 aren\u2019t in yet, but they are expected to follow this trend.\nA big contributor to this turn-around comes from insurers using advanced data analytics to help manage their business. By leveraging big data and predictive analytics, insurers do a much better job of making sure riskier businesses pay more and lower risk businesses pay less. It helps insurers to become more profitable while also giving their customers a fair price.\nOne great example of a company that has done this well is Farm Bureau Financial Services. They offer many types of insurance but were struggling with workers\u2019 compensation. Underwriting performance was deteriorating rapidly and the competition was outperforming them. Immediate action was required to bring this line of insurance back to profitability. True pros, Farm Bureau implemented predictive analytics into their underwriting process with the best execution plan we\u2019ve seen. They empowered their underwriters with new tools to make better decisions, and in just six months they saw significant improvement and are now profitable.\n#2: E-Commerce Comes to Insurance\nLittered throughout 2014 were big announcements that the technology industry is preparing to make its mark on insurance. From Google to Facebook to online retailers Walmart, Sam\u2019s Club and Overstock, the technology revolution is swirling around insurance as one of the last major industries in need of modernizing.\nFor some this type of change is intimidating, but many insurers see the opportunity for innovation and a chance to reinvent the relationship they have with their customers. Insurance companies and agents will do very well over the next decade when they leverage in-depth relationships with their customers and combine them with innovative solutions and today\u2019s customer experience expectations. Customers will also win as they will have more choice, real-time customer service and increased transparency.\n#3: Millennials Meet Insurance\nIn an industry buzzing with how it\u2019s going to reinvent itself, there\u2019s a lot to learn from Millennials about staying relevant. And, insurance is listening. MyPath is a new web portal to draw Millennials to the diverse career potential insurance has to offer.

they have to say!\u201d\nThe Ghost of Insurance Past\nSoon after, Ebenezer was visited by the Ghost of Insurance Past.\u00a0 The spirit beckoned Ebenezer on a journey into the past, and showed him visions from his younger years.\u00a0 Ebenezer marveled at the simplicity of it all. \u00a0Independent agents were in charge.\u00a0 Data needs were minimal, and computing was hard \u2013 but companies that could build more sophisticated rate plans were big winners.\u00a0 Reputation was king; companies competed (and won) on their good name and financial strength.\nIt was a world very familiar to Ebenezer.\u00a0 It was the insurance industry he grew up in, the industry that he first fell in love with.\u00a0 But Ebenezer now saw it with apprehension.\u00a0 He recognized the many things that had changed, things that could no longer be.\nAnd then, just like that, the spirit departed and Ebenezer was alone.\nThe Ghost of Insurance Present\nShortly after, Ebenezer was visited by the Ghost of Insurance Present.\u00a0 The spirit called to Ebenezer and showed him how things were in present day, including many things that Ebenezer had not previously noticed.\u00a0 He saw the increasingly savvy direct purchasers of insurance, not relying on agents to guide them.\u00a0 He saw carriers using new sorts of data in very novel ways.\u00a0 He saw adverse selection emerge as a primary vulnerability \u2013 and for some carriers, a key competitive weapon.\nThe spirit showed Ebenezer how the rules were changing with data and analytics; that even small companies could now perform very sophisticated pricing analysis, and that the key differentiator now was not reputation, but data.\u00a0 The carriers with the most data, and the ability to analyze it, were in the driver\u2019s seat.\nFinally, the spirit showed Ebenezer something he had never noticed before: the interlopers.\u00a0 There at the fringes, testing the waters, looking to break into the insurance market were scores of non-insurance firms.\u00a0 Social media networks, online retailers, and brick and mortar stores all had plans to compete with traditional insurance companies.\u00a0 They were empowered by the depth and breadth of their customer data, but the insurance companies didn\u2019t seem to notice this new threat.\nEbenezer was amazed.\nAnd then, just like that, the spirit departed and Ebenezer was alone.\nThe Ghost of Insurance Future\nImmediately, the third spirit appeared: the Ghost of Insurance Future.\u00a0 He showed Ebenezer an amazing future, the likes of which he could hardly believe.\u00a0 There were no recognizable \u201cInsurance Companies\u201d any longer \u2013 just consumer service companies that packaged insurance products with financial products, consulting services, data, and physical products.\nThe spirit showed Ebenezer how data and analytics had evolved to their natural conclusion: the insurance product was no different in the end from a communications product, a financial product, or the sale of a physical product.\u00a0 Firms that could successfully combine all of these data streams into one view were ultimately the most successful at leveraging profit across the entire spectrum.\nIn this world, data and analytics weren\u2019t merely important things.\u00a0 They were the only things that mattered.\u00a0 Executing in a Data-Driven Decision making (D3) culture was the new key to organizational success.\nThe independent agents were gone, replaced by financial consultants and customer service reps who helped buyers manage their insurance needs within the scope of their larger packages.\nThe carriers that didn\u2019t embrace these changes were also gone.\u00a0 Without the data to compete, they lost their best business year after year to the new market, and slowly dwindled away.\u00a0 There were plenty of familiar names among the successful carriers, but without fail they had partnered with (or were owned by) other consumer services and products companies.\nEbenezer saw that his beloved Time Tested Insurance stood shuttered and abandoned, and he gasped in shock.\nAnd then, just like that, the spirit departed and Ebenezer was again alone.\nOf Course, There\u2019s A Happy Ending\nWhen his staff returned to work after Christmas, Ebenezer was a changed man.\u00a0 \u201cData and analytics aren\u2019t merely important,\u201d he told his staff.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re the only things that matter!\u201d\nHe ordered that the Missouri filing be put on hold (it would be his first missed filing date in three decades) while a team studied the underlying cause of their loss ratio shift in the state.\nHe petitioned management to begin an Organizational Readiness Assessment for a shift to D3.\nHe commissioned a task force to begin rebuilding a data warehouse \u2013 not using extracts and encodings of customer data, but straight-through storage of every data point on every transaction.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it all and figure out how to analyze it later,\u201d he told his staff.\nAnd finally, he did something for the intern Bob Cratchit. \u00a0Since Bob was both new and enthusiastic, he hired Bob into a permanent position, and set Bob up as the point person to evaluate predictive analytics tools and options.\u00a0 \u201cI want the whole department to embrace advanced analytics.\u00a0 Bob, you go out and survey the market, the tools, and the classes we should be taking to get up to speed. \u201c\nAnd Bob did.\u00a0 And the department did.\u00a0 And, with Ebenezer\u2019s help, Time Tested grew, and thrived, and blessed its employees with a lavish 401(k) match.\u00a0 Every one.\nphoto credit: Mraz Center for the Performing Arts via photopin cc\n ",

telling you how much you\u2019ve taught me?\u00a0 Or that the years we\u2019ve spent together in the insurance industry have been the happiest of my life?\u00a0 I could say these things \u2013 and they would be true \u2013 but I have to admit (and I\u2019m sorry if this is painful for you) that I\u2019ve found a new ratio.\nWhen I first met Predicted Loss Ratio (I call her Polly), she was just coming out of a new predictive model.\u00a0 Polly wasn\u2019t overtly flashy, so I almost didn\u2019t notice her at first.\u00a0 However, something about her reminded me a lot of you \u2013 at first, anyway \u2013 and we started spending some time together.\u00a0 That\u2019s when I noticed so many ways that you and Polly are actually different.\nPolly is always thinking of the future and helps me see exactly where I\u2019m going.\u00a0 You, on the other hand, are always stuck in the past, always pointing out where I\u2019ve just been.\u00a0 With you, I always know that you\u2019ll help point out my mistakes, but not until after the fact, while Polly helps me see more clearly what I\u2019m doing today and how to avoid some of those mistakes.\nPolly is so\u2026predictable.\u00a0 When she talks to me, she\u2019s transparent.\u00a0 I can understand not only what she\u2019s saying to me, but why.\u00a0 In a way, I guess you could say that Polly is almost scripted, or formulaic.\u00a0 When I talk to you, Loss Ratio, I sometimes feel lost.\u00a0 You are so opaque.\u00a0 You tell me you have bad news, but then you make me play twenty questions before you tell me why.\nLoss Ratio, compared to Polly, you\u2019re just so\u2026random.\u00a0 I used to find our random\u00a0walks together interesting, but now that I\u2019ve met Polly, I have to say that I\u2019m enjoying the stability.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that you are always changing your mind.\u00a0 I\u2019ve come to accept the fact that you\u2019ll give me one answer today, but then you\u2019ll tell me something different next year or even next month.\nWhen I go out on insurance business meetings, Polly always comes with me and speaks with power when I\u2019m talking with small accounts or individual agents.\u00a0 You never have any credibility when you talk about any of these little things; you only have credibility when you could talk about the big picture.\nIn a way, I think maybe your number one shortcoming is that you are always too immature.\u00a0 For years, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve been waiting for you to develop.\u00a0 Polly, on the other hand, was fully mature on the day we first met.\nLoss Ratio, you\u2019ve taught me so much over the years, so I think we should still be friends.\u00a0 Really, I don\u2019t think I can ever truly let go because you\u2019re still such an authority on so many things.\u00a0 We should still get together a couple times a year though just to touch base and see how we\u2019re doing, but from now on when I\u2019m making plans or thinking of the future, I\u2019m going to stick with Polly.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nBret\n\u00a0\nphoto credit: Free Grunge Textures \u2013 www.freestock.ca via photopin cc\n ", "title": "Goodbye, Loss Ratio",

year again, when we pause to give thanks for our many blessings.\u00a0 With apologies to the Mayflower voyagers at the risk of sounding irreverent, I\u2019d like to give thanks in this column for advances in predictive analytics.\n\u00a0\nThank you, fast computers\nOne of the foundational methods in predictive analytics, the GLM (Generalized Linear Model), was first introduced in 1972.\u00a0 At that time, the only way to actually perform a GLM analysis was via mainframe.\u00a0 The state of the art in 1972 was the IBM Model S/370 165, which operated at 17 MHz and cost nearly $3 million dollars, if you purchased two 64MB hard drives (each as big as a washing machine).\u00a0 Needless to say, not a lot of folks were playing around with GLM in those days \u2013 most of the work was being done \u201con paper\u201d or \u201cin theory\u201d long before the instructions were finally sent off to the mainframe for calculation.\nWe now have available on our desktops (or laptops) processors with a thousand times more processing power and 10,000 times more storage, for less than 1/1000 the price.\u00a0 That\u2019s a million times more performance for the same price!\n\u00a0\nThank you, big data\nBig data depends first on big storage.\u00a0 Even in the 1990s, storage was an issue.\u00a0 At my first job in the insurance industry, I learned that we stored our policyholder and claim data on magnetic tapes, each holding 20GB of storage, and that those tapes were housed in a silo 50 miles away, where a robot would change the tape in the drive when I requested particular data.\u00a0 We had thousands of tapes in the silos \u2013 something like 40 terabytes of total storage.\nNevertheless, we agonized over every byte we stored.\u00a0 We would compress data, convert continuous data to categorical, then assign those categories codes to assist in more efficient storage.\u00a0 I can\u2019t imagine how much of our policyholder data we weren\u2019t capturing along the way in our effort to decrease the storage burden.\nWith the advent of cheap storage (you can store 40 terabytes on a dozen USB drives now) the need to re-factor data and build structured data warehouses has been lifted.\u00a0 The new mantra is to \u201cjust save it all\u201d because storage prices will keep coming down, and our ability to process all of that unstructured data will someday catch up with the mountain of data we\u2019ve accumulated.\nThere\u2019s signal in that data, so don\u2019t throw any away.\u00a0 What could be easier?\n\u00a0\nThank you, free education\nIt\u2019s amazing the places you can go to get a free education in predictive analytics these days. The following are great resources to get started:\n\nCoursera.org offers full university courses on dozens of data analytics topics.\nKaggle.com conducts predictive modeling contests \u2013 and has a vibrant community of enthusiasts willing to review your code or give you feedback on how to improve your methods.\nCodecademy.com will teach you a new programming language, absolutely free.\n\n\u00a0\nThank you, free research\nWith predictive modeling entering the mainstream, more and more academic research is being performed on analytical methods, and more companies are also publishing results of their research.\u00a0 So much of the heavy lifting has already been done.\u00a0 Sometimes the solution to your problem is just as easy as finding someone out there who has already faced the same problem, solved it, and published the results.\nA few of the outstanding resources here include:\n\nThe Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman\nData Analysis and Graphics Using R, by John Maindonald\nUser forums discussing projects and competitions on Kaggle.com\n\n\u00a0\nThank you, free tools\nMy very first foray into the world of predictive modeling was in the late 90\u2019s.\u00a0 At that time, the equipment I was using included a server array, an Oracle Database, and SAS software.\u00a0 The total cost was somewhere around $100,000, and this was just a small development project.\u00a0 For carriers with models in production at the time, the hardware and software costs easily went into the millions.\nOver time, many of the most expensive parts of predictive analytics have seen the release of free and/or open source alternatives:\n\nLinux high-performance server O/S\nMySQL and PostgreSQL database systems\nR and KNIME data analytics\nHadoop and MongoDB for Big Data storage, access, and distributed processing\n\n\u00a0\nAnd these are just a few examples \u2013 the list and the examples go on and on.\nPredictive analytics has come a long ways in the last 40 years.\u00a0 It started as a very theoretical effort, led by a team of data scientists and executed on multi-million dollar hardware running multi-million dollar software.\u00a0 Today, predictive analytics can be tackled as a hobby by a high school student, taking free courses to learn how to use free software on an aging notebook computer.\u00a0 Perhaps because of this, predictive analytics has fully entered the mainstream.\u00a0 It\u2019s not seen as an indecipherable black box, but now as one of the fundamental building blocks of business data analysis.\nWe\u2019ve come a long way, and it feels like we\u2019re just getting started.\u00a0 For that, too, I\u2019m thankful.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019d like to explore more about underwriting analytics, big data and the technology revolution in insurance, be sure to register for the Valen Summit in March, with keynote speaker Patrick Byrne (CEO, Overstock) and Featured Guest Speakers, including Matt Mosher, from A.M.

it also has to be the model which has a high probability of success in application.\u00a0 For example, if the model is one which underwriters will use to help them make better business decisions, then choose a model which has transparency and is intuitive, not a model which relies on complex machine learning techniques.\nSimilar to the previous myth, if you use the wrong predictive model, it doesn\u2019t matter that you get everything right.\nMyth: Predictive modeling only works well for personal lines\nFact: Personal lines were the first areas of success for predictive modeling, owing to their large, homogeneous populations.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t to say that commercial lines are immune to the power of predictive modeling, however.\u00a0 There are successful models in production today producing risk scores for Workers Compensation, E&S Liability, and even Directors & Officers risks. \u00a0One of the keys to deploying predictive models to lines with thin policy data is to supplement that data, either with industry-wide statistics, or with third-party (not necessarily insurance) data.\nMyth: Better predictive modeling will give me accurate prices at the policy level\nFact: Until someone invents a time machine, the premiums we charge at inception will always be wrong.\u00a0 For policies that end up being loss-free, we will charge too much.\u00a0 For the policies that end up having losses, we will charge too little.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t a bad thing, however.\u00a0 In fact, this cross subsidization is the fundamental purpose of insurance, and is necessary.\nInstead of being 100% accurate at the policy level, the objective we should aim for in predictive analytics is to segment the entire portfolio of risks into smaller subdivisions, each of which is accurately priced.\u00a0 See the difference?\u00a0 Now the low risk policies can cross-subsidize one another (and enjoy a lower rate) and the high risk policies will also cross-subsidize one another (but at a high rate).\u00a0 In this way, the final premiums charged will be more fair for every policyholder.\nMyth: Good predictive models will give me the right answers\nFact: Good models will answer very specific questions, but unless you\u2019re asking the right questions, your model isn\u2019t necessarily going to give you useful answers.\u00a0 Take time during the due diligence phase to figure out what the key questions are.\u00a0 Then when you start selecting or building models, you\u2019ll be more likely to select a model with answers to the most important questions.\nFor example, there are (at least) two very different approaches to loss modeling:\n\nPure premium (loss) models can tell you which risks have the highest potential for loss. They don\u2019t necessarily tell you why this is true, or whether or not the risk is profitable.\nLoss Ratio models can tell you which risks are the most profitable, where your rate plan may be out of alignment with risk, or where the potential for loss is highest. However, they may not necessarily be able to differentiate between these scenarios.\n\nMake sure that the model is in perfect alignment with the most important questions to receive the greatest benefit from predictive analytics.\n\u00a0\nphoto credit: YaelBeeri via photopin cc\n ", "title": "Top 6 Myths about Predictive Modeling", "author": "\nBy Bret Shroyer, FCAS\n", "polarity": 0.1528546176046176, "subjectivity": 0.5536853655603654}, "insurance-data-and-analytics-revolution": {"content": "\nThe Insurance Data and Analytics Revolution\nIt\u2019s a very interesting time for our industry \u2013 to say the least \u2013 and industry\u00a0executives are gathering to highlight the insurance\u00a0data and analytics revolution at Valen\u2019s Summit next March.

Implementing data and analytics is the only way to keep the insurance industry alive, especially as new data-driven technology and retail companies enter the field.\nThe intimate, peer-forum event will tackle the issue of increasingly rapid adoption of data and analytics within insurance companies, combined with the potential impact from technology companies such as Overstock entering the insurance industry.\nPatrick M.

This is insurance done right\u2026Millions of consumers are looking for more affordable insurance. We\u2019re here to help.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWant to Hear Why Patrick Byrne Entered Insurance?\nClick Here Now for\u00a0a Front Row Seat!\n\u00a0\nForewarned is Forearmed\nInsurance has recently become more interesting to companies with money to burn. Hedge funds are upping their bets in reinsurance and expecting lucrative returns as well as tax benefits. They are making a notable impact, moving from traditional sidecar investments to starting their own reinsurance businesses. Many worry whether they will have the stomach to remain for the long haul when the next big catastrophe hits.\nIn primary insurance, its e-commerce giants like Google, Amazon and Overstock, and retailers like Walmart and IKEA who are making waves. When these companies see dollar signs in new industries, it\u2019s because they believe there are fundamental inefficiencies that can be exploited.\n\u00a0\nHow Tech Companies Disrupt New Markets\nFirst up is to apply data-driven strategies to customer acquisition. According to The Economist\u2019s survey, The Way Forward: Insurance in an age of customer intimacy and Internet of Things, insurance executives agree \u2014 they declared distribution (i.e. acquisition) as the number one vulnerability for disruption.\nWhat\u2019s particularly troubling is that half the respondents don\u2019t really know how well prepared the insurance industry is for the changes coming in the next five years. They score the industry a 3 out of 5 for preparedness. You could call that punting \u2013 and the industry can\u2019t afford to punt, especially now.\nA common theory is that these tech and retail giants are turning to insurance because there is an opportunity to scale. For instance, within workers\u2019 compensation, many insurers and agents compete heavily for the bigger commercial accounts, but overlook the majority of the market in small commercial.\nTransaction-oriented tech companies approach markets very differently. Once they learn the business and prove the economic model (in the case of insurance through personal lines), they execute a go-to-market strategy to grab market share at scale. Our research shows that small commercial accounts make up 85% of the market. While big accounts will remain a priority, now is the time to consider how to make your portfolio less vulnerable to losing market share.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding Millennials as New Customers\nAt 76.6 million strong, millennials currently make up the largest generation in the U.S. Unfortunately for the industry, they also happen to be the demographic most dissatisfied with insurance products and services, which makes them more easily wooed by insurance offers from technology and e-commerce giants they already know and trust. Millennials represent $1.68 trillion in purchasing power, so it is crucial for the industry to adapt to serve the needs of their future customers, business owners and employees.\nTake into consideration that as much as 90% of customer research is done before a phone call is made. That means that companies who can provide as much transparency as possible about how they work and what they offer is increasingly important. According to a J.D. Power survey, millennials strongly favor companies with easy-to-navigate websites, and they don\u2019t always base decisions on price alone as previous generations were prone to do. Insurers who don\u2019t provide the experience the next generation is looking for put their market share at risk.\nWhen catering to millennials as new customers, prioritizing the customer experience and positioning yourself as a forward-thinking insurer is key. Take a cue from how consumers feel about another industry: banking. A recent \u201cMillennial Disruption Index\u201d found that the leading banks in the U.S. were all among the ten least-loved brands by this generation. It comes as no surprise, then, that 73% of millennials would consider opting into new financial services from companies they recognize \u2014 Google, Amazon, Apple, PayPal and Square \u2013 over their current bank. You don\u2019t want this to also happen to you.\n\u00a0\nValen\u2019s Summit Brings the Right Mix of Experts to You\nIn addition to Overstock, our Summit will feature numerous industry leaders, including a presentation from Matt Mosher, SVP of Rating Services for A.M. Best, on how insurance data and analytically driven insurers improve ratings and financial projections.\nThree insurance CEOs will bring their perspective on what it takes to win in today\u2019s competitive underwriting environment:\n\nRobert Darby, President of Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, will share what it takes to recruit, retain and develop analytically-minded talent.\nMartin Welch, CEO of Hawaii Employers\u2019 Mutual Insurance, will discuss what new skills insurance leaders need to manage the large-scale changes they face.\nSteve Hartman, President and CEO of Falls Lake Insurance Companies will provide his first-hand account of what it takes to be a change agent and how to evolve your underwriting organization by including experienced staff and new team members.\n\nYou simply cannot afford to miss the Valen Summit, taking place in Vail, Colorado from March 3 through 6, 2015.\n\u00a0\nClick here for more information or to register today!\n\u00a0\nphoto credit: ImNotQuiteJack via photopin cc\n ", "title": "Valen Summit: Overstock CEO Underscores Changing Market Dynamics in Insurance", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.13306393427361174, "subjectivity": 0.4560107992366054}, "valen-summit-2015-announced-gold-rush": {"content": "\n\nSUMMIT 2015: THE GOLD RUSH!\n\nMARCH 3-6, 2015\nVAIL, COLORADO\nJoin us for our 2015 Summit focused on the increasingly rapid adoption of data and analytics within insurance companies combined with the potential impact from technology giants entering insurance.

They needed to help their underwriters better identify pockets of profitability within their target markets. They also wanted to know which agents were sending them the best business, whether they were competitively pricing that business, and ultimately lowering their loss ratio.\nThey kept hearing about instances where carriers\u2019 loss ratios were suffering because they were being adversely selected against by other carriers who were using predictive analytics. This particular carrier was less worried about it happening within their existing portfolio; they were focused on how to grow into new markets. But they wanted to grow in the right way.\nThey were putting in place a strategy to create steady and profitable growth in newer regions and class codes, along with a new agency plan that would produce a durable, competitive advantage. It was important for them to leverage new data and information because they knew they were going up against competitors with niche expertise in these new markets. The competition had a leg up in terms of knowing the idiosyncrasies and jurisdictional differences in these new states and they needed a tool that leveled the playing field.\nWith that backdrop, their logical next step was to evaluate whether they could leverage advanced data and analytics to provide them with the knowledge they lacked in-house for these new markets. They reached out to Valen for help because we provide both data and analytics.\nWe partnered together and created a predictive analytic framework that leveraged our consortium database to give their underwriters the confidence they needed to select and price risk profitably, and \u00a0meet their growth numbers.\nSo the natural question is\u2026 how did it work?\nWe started with a detailed analysis of 41,500 policies representing $432 million in premium. Those policies had an aggregate loss ratio of 70.3%.\nWhen this carrier entered the market using advanced data and analytics, they immediately realized a significant advantage even over those carriers with the niche expertise that we mentioned earlier. They were able to identify more than 28,000 policies they could write profitably out of the initial 41,500 that we studied. Those 28,000 policies added up to $320 million or 74% of the total available premium. And, they could expect those policies to come in at a loss ratio of 61%. Looks good at a 9 point gain, right? Hold on, because it gets better.\nThe 9 point gain is actually just the beginning of the story, because the remaining $112 million in business that they would now send to the competition represented the worst business in those markets \u2013 to the tune of a 96.8% loss ratio.\nWhy such a dramatic difference? It comes down to the combination of risk selection and pricing. The question you have to ask yourself is can you pick the right risks and give them the right price? Carriers lose first when they choose the wrong risks and they lose even more when they get the price wrong.\nBottom line, this particular carrier moved forward using predictive analytics to grow into 20 new states and open up the number of class codes they write. Their strategy has allowed them to grow profitability and consistently.\nI\u2019d say it worked out pretty well.\n ", "title": "How To Grow Profitably and Avoid Adverse Selection", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.15683772246272246, "subjectivity": 0.5085370069745069}, "identify-loss-ratio-difference-between-loss-free-workers-compensation-policies": {"content": "\nToday we made a pretty big announcement \u2013 we launched our new Risk Score.\nIt\u2019s an involved process that requires months of trial and error and rigorous testing. The Risk Score is a comparison tool that separates good risks from bad on new and renewal workers\u2019 compensation policies. The best risks are defined as those within the top 10 percent of premium, while the worst risks represent the bottom 10 percent of premium in terms of loss ratio performance. Underwriters use the Risk Score, which is part of our InsureRight Platform, to select and price policies more accurately.\nClick Here to Find Out How Your Competitors Beat Adverse Selection!\nWhat\u2019s most exciting from our perspective is the partnership we are building with insurers around actionable data. Everyone benefits when insurers come together to pool their data, because it opens doors to solutions that push the industry forward. Our data consortium has grown by 40 percent CAGR since 2010, the last time we released a Risk Score. With this growth, we were able to leverage thousands of data variables to find the best leading indicators of risk for this new version.

Their underwriting team had a lot of expertise and in depth knowledge about their market, but they were savvy to the notion that advanced data and analytics can create adverse selection. It was a smart move from them to figure out how vulnerable they would be if a new competitor entered their market or an existing competitor started using predictive analytics.\nThey had three fundamental questions to answer:\n\nHow vulnerable was their book to new competitors?\nHow well was their current model working?\nDid they have enough data in their model?\n\nWe help carriers with this type of analysis all the time. In order to take real action following this exercise, it needs to be specific to the scenarios an individual carrier faces. It\u2019s easy for us to show that most carriers have vulnerability, but what matters is how that would actually play out for your market and your book of business.\nIn this case, the carrier actually had an existing model in place using their own data. And they wanted to know what would happen if a carrier using a model built from more robust industry-wide data started to compete against them.\nHere\u2019s what it looked like in the head-to-head comparison.\nTheir loss ratio over a 4 year period was 66.7%. But, things changed pretty drastically with a competitor using more robust data for their predictive model.\u00a0 This carrier\u2019s loss ratio jumped to 79.3% and the competitor came in at 59.1%. That spread of 20.2, or what we call the \u201closs ratio differential,\u201d is the difference between their loss ratio and the new competitor\u2019s.\nAs you can imagine, this didn\u2019t sit well with the carrier. From this analysis, we were able to answer their initial question around quantifying how vulnerable they were to a competitive threat. They were vulnerable to the tune of 12.6 loss ratio points, meaning their loss ratio could rise by 12.6 points if a savvy competitor came in and stole profitable market share.\nAnd now? They\u2019ve moved forward using a model that contains more data than they have in-house.\u00a0 By leveraging a broader market view, they\u2019re sitting pretty with 2013 loss ratio of 50 points.\nphoto credit: sniggie via photopin cc\nphoto credit: skyloader via photopin cc\n ", "title": "CAUTION: Predictive Analytics Is Helping Your Competitors", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.09666821273964131, "subjectivity": 0.47999381570810146}, "farm-bureau-financial-services-analytics-implementation": {"content": "\nClick Here to Find Out How To Protect Your Book From The Competition!\n\nKIRSTIN MARR:\nWelcome to the \u201cToday\u2019s Underwriting Battleground: Where Belief and Data Collide\u201d web seminar hosted by Valen Analytics and Farm Bureau Financial Services. I\u2019m Kirstin Marr, VP of Marketing for Valen.\nWe will begin by introducing our featured speakers.\nSteve Wittmuss is Commercial Vice President for Farm Bureau Financial Services. Steve has held several positions at Farm Bureau, including running specific business units and as regional claims vice president. Steve began his insurance career at Farm Bureau Insurance Company of Nebraska and joined the Farm Bureau Financial Services organization in 2003.\nMatt Frazier is head of workers\u2019 compensation strategy for Valen Analytics, an advanced data and analytics company. Prior to joining Valen, Matt served as Sr. VP of Sales at AmTrust Financial where he was responsible for nationwide expansion of their workers compensation product. He also held several roles at FirstComp Insurance Company in underwriting, marketing and business development.\nMatt will get us started off with an overview of important market dynamics to consider as carriers look to improve underwriting profitability in workers\u2019 compensation. Steve will share how Farm Bureau has successfully implemented predictive analytics into the underwriting workflow.\nMatt, I\u2019ll turn it over to you to begin.\nMATT FRAZIER:\nA number of industry trends have recently come together that point to an increasingly complex marketplace.\u00a0 From 2005 to 2012, Return on Equity dropped from 10% to 4% for companies with a combined ratio of 100.\u00a0 And given the fixed yield investment maturities predominate in most insurance carrier portfolios, the low investments yield hangover most of us are still reeling from is still a pressure to find ways to lower combined ratios. We all know: when ROE goes down, you have to make improvements in combined ratio to make up for that loss.\nThe problem is exacerbated for companies with combined ratios over 100. According to the Insurance Information Institute, commercial lines carriers need to drop combined ratio 3.6% for every 1% decline in investment yield in order to maintain a constant ROE. You can see on this chart for workers\u2019 compensation the combined ratio number is even larger at 5.7%, due to a longer tail and the typically longer investment maturities for that LOB.\nWith an average 2012 Work Comp combined ratio of 110.4, it\u2019s no wonder that carriers are increasingly focused on increasing profitability in underwriting. Ernst & Young, in their 2014 P&C Outlook report, pointed to the fact that the best performing carriers are leveraging data and analytics to refine market segmentation strategies across the board. What E&Y found is that pricing and underwriting discipline is proving to be a primary driver in improving financial performance.\nThe word discipline here speaks to using better tools to promote consistency and increased rigor with regard to pricing to risk. They also call out work comp as a line of business showing promising signs of combining strong pricing with moderating loss performance to drive underwriting profitability. Bottom line \u2013 there\u2019s a more sophisticated market emerging, which is creating a greater urgency for individual carriers to maintain their competitive advantage. Today, the market spells opportunity for those willing to embrace new analytics technology, and doom for those that are last to the lunch table.\nOne place we see increasing sophistication is around risk selection and pricing. One leading indicator of increased market sophistication is the number of carriers we\u2019ve talked to that worry deeply about adverse selection and how to measure it. Notice Company B in this exhibit. Company B has decided not to embrace analytics to better separate risk along the entire spectrum of predictive characteristics. They underwrite and price based on the tradition approach indicated by the horizontal line, maintaining a conservative overall pricing and risk selection perspective, but better risks are largely subsidizing worse risks.\nCompany A enters the marketplace using a data driven strategy and systematically capitalizes on non-obvious risk characteristics.\u00a0 As a result Company A\u2019s pricing strategy segments risk in Company B\u2019s portfolio in a way that systematically gives Company A the competitive edge for business in the green. Company A eats that market share. Company B ends up with the business in the black, or, as it were in the RED at the pricing levels at which the market is clearing.\nWhy? Because carriers with more sophisticated pricing methodologies win more of the best risks and do a better job avoiding the bad risks. Those bad risks end up being written by their competition.\u00a0 Being able to identify whether adverse selection is happening to your portfolio is critical \u2013 and the sooner you know, the sooner you can take action to protect your market share.\nTo put the situation into a predictive analytic frame we often talk about deciles or bins into which these predictive analytic technologies will categorize populations of policies.\u00a0 The better risks are given a score of 1, 2, or 3 the average risks a score of 4, 5, or 6 and the worst risks in a portfolio are given a score of 8, 9, and 10. This is just one way to think about a prediction or a predictive score.\nIf a carrier\u2018s portfolio score is trending up it can indicate adverse selection.\u00a0 If the pricing is not trending up with the portfolio score, it may indicate rate inadequacy or what I call adverse selection inertia, which, if not proactively addressed can be the \u201cend of days\u201d for a carrier. This bin framework will come up again later as we dialogue about predictive analytic implementation.\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at how market share breaks out in workers\u2019 compensation today. When you look at a quick snapshot that shows the distribution of market share by the 110.4% 2012 average combined ratio, it illustrates how market share consolidation can play itself out over time. Today, 20% of the market is writing at an underwriting profit and 44% writes at worse than average performance.\nFor a moment, let\u2019s focus on these 2 groups. What are the top performers doing to achieve better than average results, and what do they know that the other group doesn\u2019t?\nWell\u2026 the 20% achieving an underwriting profit know the risks that they are writing and retaining better than their competition, and are able to consistently make better risk selection and pricing decisions. Additionally, they are successfully identifying pockets of the market where they can build margin into their risk portfolio.\nThe best performing carriers take their proprietary knowledge and infuse it into their business operations, with a focus mainly on pricing and underwriting.\nIt\u2019s critical to note, lest you think this is all about David vs. Goliath that the top 20 in term of Market Share are fairly evenly spaced out along this continuum with 9 of the top 20 carriers performing worse than the average combined. This isn\u2019t about large vs. small carriers. It\u2019s about who knows more about what they insure.\nThis tells me that, unless a poor performing carrier is willing to spend the time, resources, and technology KNOWING WHAT THEY INSURE better than their competition, they will be vulnerable to adverse selection by their competitors.\nAnd finally, what about the group of insurers in the middle?\u00a0 Here\u2019s the group to keep your eye on. If this group implements the strategies currently being used by the profitable group, they have the opportunity to steal market share from that group, and also send their most unprofitable segments to the worst performing group.\nWhen we look at this 2012 snapshot, we see that nearly half the market is poised to grab profitable market share. Which side of the moat are on? If you are in the 20% of the market currently enjoying an underwriting profit, how will you protect your market share? Niche players will no longer be able to rely as heartily on specialized knowledge.\nIf you are writing at or above the average combined ratio, are you being adversely selected against? How do you know? Is your underwriting operation ready to embrace a data driven, test & learn, discover and improve ethos. How will you protect your book of business from taking on poor performing risks that your competitors are no longer writing? How will you compete for the better parts of your portfolio? Are you using your data to build a durable moat, or is the Trojan Horse already in the castle?\nThe race for market share is a natural outgrowth when industries become more sophisticated in customer acquisition, retention and pricing strategies.\nThis dynamic isn\u2019t new to insurance. If we look at personal auto, market share consolidation is a done deal with 80% of the market share held by the top 10 carriers. Progressive comes to mind as the first company in auto insurance that embraced new ways of using data and analytics to gain profitable market share in the non-standard auto business. Now, its table stakes. Very few personal auto carriers are not using increasingly sophisticated data driven strategies to defend, protect, and advance. Going after a risky market means you have to be confident that you know which part of that market will be profitable.\nProgressive was an early adopter of predictive analytics, like credit score, and that provided the confidence they needed in their pricing approach. They knew more about individual consumers then their competition did. Progressive was only too happy to share competitive rates with consumers, which allowed them to write business at the price they felt adequately covered their risk \u2013 creating positive selection for them and adverse selection for their\u00a0 competitors who were quoting a lower price on what Progressive determined were the worse-performing risks.\nGEICO is another iconic example. They\u2019ve leveraged their direct writing business model to offer lower premiums and dwarf the competitions\u2019 advertising budgets. These examples provide a really good preview for how other P/C lines will evolve as data and analytics become more pervasive.\nOf course, we all know the examples in other industries of companies that outperformed their competition and became dominant market leaders.\nThe common thread, in and out of insurance, is the evolution of organizations becoming more analytically-driven.\nA final trend that is top of mind for insurance executives that we speak with on a regular basis, is the need for top talent. Insurance recruiting firm, The Jacobson Group, has reported that 50 percent of the insurance workforce is set to retire within the next 10-15 years, and that at least 200,000 new positions will be added by the year 2020. At the same time, McKinsey noted in a May 2010 Report that 20% of the underwriting workforce is nearing retirement and they estimated we will need 25,000 new underwriters by 2014. Who will replace our most tenured underwriting staff? It\u2019s the younger generation, as 50% of the U.S. workforce will come from the Millennial generation in the next 5 years or so.\nBefore considering the needs around training a more junior workforce, the industry is pressed with the question of whether this younger generation will see insurance as an attractive industry with exciting career potential. And, as many insurers now lament, recruiting competition for analytics talent is fierce. Our industry is in competition with the likes of Facebook and Google.\nMany studies have been conducted on what the Millennial generation takes into consideration when making career decisions. On the screen is a sample list of questions they often ask themselves about a specific job opportunity. We need a way to communicate that insurance offers an incredibly valuable service to consumers and businesses alike, helping to facilitate home ownership and entrepreneurship through shared risk. And, we have an incredible opportunity for bright, talented minds to innovate using advanced data and analytics to improve underwriting profits, as one example.\nThe macro trends we reviewed today are evidence of a more sophisticated and complex marketplace, which require new rules of engagement for acquiring and retaining profitable business.\nKirstin, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.\nKIRSTIN MARR:\nThank you Matt. We\u2019re going to switch gears a bit for a Q&A session with Steve Wittmuss of Farm Bureau Financial Services. Steve has a valuable example to share of how carriers can succeed using advanced tools in the underwriting and across the organization.\nLet\u2019s start off by learning your story \u2013 where were you at, how did you decide to start using analytics and you did you implement the process?\nSTEVE WITTMUSS:\nThank you\nFarm Bureau Financial Services is a Regional Property Casualty Insurance Company that writes business in 8 states. The majority of our books is in personal lines, but there is a push to grow our commercial book of business. We identify our markets as main street businesses.\nI think we were fairly typical for a commercial writer of our size \u2013 we did not specifically underwrite our work comp business.\u00a0 We underwrote the rest of the risk and if we liked that part, we took the work the comp. So a couple of things occurred to us:\n\nOur loss ratio really blew up around 2010.\u00a0 If you remember the chart earlier where they showed companies based on loss ratio \u2013 we were in the upper end for work comp and very unprofitable, but the rest of our book was profitable. We knew we had to make a change with our work comp.\nOur underwriters had limited knowledge on what to look for when underwriting work comp. If our only response was to tell our underwriters to underwrite work comp, we would not be successful.\n\nMy first introduction to using analytics was when I worked with personal lines auto, so I know how predictive modeling works.\u00a0 In personal lines auto we were able to level out our loss ratios by risk class with rate differences between the classes by up to 40%. \u00a0So I knew if I found the right tool that predictive modeling would work for work comp too.\nUsing data analytics allows you to be more efficient \u2013 you now underwrite by exception rather than try and underwriting everything.\u00a0 Even if you have an experienced UW staff, they still only see a fraction of the potential risks that are out there and many times they never see the overall picture on how profitable a book is.\nThat means underwriters work based on their rules.\u00a0 If they had a large loss on a risk, they may exclude that going forward.\u00a0 Even if in the big picture it was a good risk.\u00a0 Predictive modeling frees the underwriter to make the decisions based on facts. So we have decided to use predictive modeling and now we have to introduce it.\nWhen introducing to your underwriters, you need to tell a story.\u00a0 Here is our problem, and here is what analytics is, and here is why it will help us.\u00a0 Remember to keep it simple and graphs work better than numbers.\u00a0 I have used the graph used earlier many times in the past.\nThere will be pushback & outliers \u2013 don\u2019t hide from this. Everyone has an example of an exception \u2013 just acknowledge that that person might be the exception, but the group as a whole is not.\nMake sure you set up systems and processes so your staff can be successful.\nThe actual underwriting decision needs to rest with the underwriter. Valen is just a tool, the UW still needs to be the final decision maker.\nMy background is in claims, and this is where you get in trouble.\u00a0 Make sure your decision makers use it as a tool, not a crutch.\nWe started off on focusing on the bottom \u00bc of our business that was unprofitable. \u00a0We built UW rules but gave the UW leeway \u2013 an example would be on risks in bin 5 they could use up to a 10% debit or credit, on a bin 9 they could use a 10% to maximum debit.\nWe also recognize it will take a while to implement entirely within our book of business.\u00a0 It is not easy to raise rates on a risk that has had no claims over the last 5 years.\u00a0 You have to give your underwriters leeway on that decision.\nFinally, you have to share your success stories.\nIn our case I can show that on 9\u2019s and 10\u2019s we were giving credits to the group as a whole and on the first renewal we changed that to giving debits to the group as a whole.\u00a0 By using that data, our underwriters know they are making a difference, one policy at a time.\nKIRSTIN MARR:\nWhy is senior level commitment so important and what does it take to secure that level of commitment?\nSTEVE WITTMUSS:\nThis is no different than any other major project.\u00a0 It has to have key support and proper resource allocation from Senior Management and it has to cascade down through various levels \u2013 whether it is communication, IT resources, or even a willingness to sell the program.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there will be pushback in multiple areas.\nUnderwriters\nFirst, you are challenging their knowledge \u2013 you need to let them know\nYou are giving them tools to help them better understand the risks they are underwriting and this allows them to manage by exception.\nSecond, you are putting them in the middle of renewals and the data.\u00a0 Again, I think you acknowledge the issue and give them time to move at less than full speed towards implementing on renewal business.\u00a0 When they see it working they will increase the usage.\nAgents\nHere you are changing the rules, so you need to be able to tell your story.\u00a0 Granted, we had it much easier here as we have captive agents.\nBut we had to stop the quoting process to make this happen.\u00a0 Prior to this agents could quote and rate the business through our system.\u00a0 Now when one of our agents quotes a WC policy, they have to stop the quoting process and contact their UW which allows them to run the Valen report and then they give the agent the amount of the quote.\nAgain, they always know someone who is the exception.\nThe Client\nYou are moving their cheese.\u00a0 Of course you will not hear from those whose rates go down from this change.\u00a0 What we have found it often when a client searches for new coverage, we are still competitive.\u00a0 You have to have faith that if you lose the business, then the other company is writing it at a loss.\nKIRSTIN MARR:\nYou touched on this a little earlier, but I think it would be good to discuss what you think are some best practices when you start to implement predicative modeling practices.\u00a0 Share the FBFS process and approach?\nSTEVE WITTMUSS:\nFirst, engage your UW staff early and often.\u00a0 You need to explain predictive modeling to your staff long before you implement any process change.\nWe started talking about using Valen\u2019s products in September and implemented in March.\u00a0 This gave the underwriters time to get use to the idea plus it allowed us to use underwriters to help develop our processes.\nDon\u2019t change more than you can handle.\nStart with the minimum you think you need to be successful.\u00a0 You can build the rest once you have some victories.\nWe started by focusing on those in bin\u2019s 8\u2019s, 9\u2019s & 10\u2019s.\nWe developed rules that still gave UW\u2019s the ability to make decisions; however, to show we were serious and to stay engaged as management, any actions on those in bin 10 require their manager or myself to be a part of the decision.\nIn addition, new business was required; renewal business had a little more leeway.\n\nWe have a very specific process set up for training on any new process we introduce.\n\nWe start by developing a job-aide.\u00a0 This is a step-by-step instruction on how the process will look going forward.\u00a0 This is an important first step \u2013 it keeps all future training grounded to this document.\u00a0 If changes need to be made to the process as we go forward, we must change our job-aide.\nEvery month we have a one-hour call for the department.\u00a0 In this call we usually 3 twenty minute segments.\u00a0 When we have a big change we use one of these segments to announce the change \u2013 along with why we are doing it and what it means for our staff.\nAfter that meeting, we have one-hour training session.\u00a0 The training flows from our Job-Aide, to the staff.\u00a0 If needed, we will schedule additional training.\nOnce the new process starts, we have one place for staff to go with their concerns or problems.\u00a0 That way we can see if we have a systems issue, a problem that is becoming a trend or it is our staff that just needs some time to adjust.\u00a0 This also provides consistency in the information provided back to the underwriters and agents.\nFinally, I have my own six week rule.\u00a0 At the launch I check with people on how things are going.\u00a0 Then I check that against how things are going at the six week mark.\u00a0 That is usually when attitudes really start to change.\u00a0 Short of a catastrophe, I try not to make any significant changes to a new process or program until that time.\nI think it is good to have some informal check points as a manager.\nKIRSTIN MARR:\nWhat are different ways carriers can think about measuring success and underwriting improvement?\nSTEVE WITTMUSS:\nFor us it has been easiest to track our renewal changes.\u00a0 You take what you had in the prior year and compare it to the current year and see what you have.\nThe first six months I can give you our numbers for what our book of business has done.\u00a0 We can see how we are using it the data for scheduled rating and the premium gains.\u00a0 I can show you how our underwriters are using the tool per underwriter.\u00a0 I can tell you the amount of premium increase we have seen. This alone has paid for the program.\nNew business has been more of a challenge for us.\u00a0 We are just starting to track our new business.\u00a0 Eventually we will be able to get the same data on new business as we are our renewal business.\u00a0 Our loss ratio has improved since we have implemented. I doubt that is due directly to the data this quickly, but I do believe that awareness by the agents and underwriters is making a difference.\nOne other way that this has helped, and I am not sure how to measure it, is underwriter engagement.\u00a0 As I said earlier, we did not really underwrite work comp prior to introducing Valen, so underwriters were concerned having to do so.\u00a0 Now however, we are discussing work comp as a group; our underwriters are engaged and feel confident that they can make good decisions.\u00a0 They are asking questions of our products and risk management staff.\u00a0 By sharing the successes we are having the underwriters see that they are making a difference and that has enhanced their engagement.\n ", "title": "Farm Bureau Financial Services Analytics Implementation", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.17664199717230017, "subjectivity": 0.4565654631563721}, "pricing-insurance-policies": {"content": "\nIf you don\u2019t have complete confidence with how you are pricing insurance policies today, it will likely cost you more than the premium you are missing out on. A lot more. Too many insurers are adopting much more sophisticated approaches to pricing and leaving their competitors in the dust.\nIf you are incorrectly pricing the risks you are writing today, you are vulnerable to a competitor stealing your best business. If a new or existing competitor introduces more aggressive pricing for the good risks, that\u2019s a warning sign that they also know when it\u2019s time to walk away from bad business \u2013 leaving you to write those worse performing policies at unprofitable rates. It\u2019s called adverse selection. This actually happened to Farm Bureau Financial Services. Watch how they turned it around in just six months.\nThere are a couple of scenarios we see often that illustrate why adverse selection occurs. First is getting it wrong on pricing insurance policies relative to the risk you are taking on. Sometimes, we see an insurer\u2019s loss ratio deteriorate simply because they are writing risks that have a much higher potential of blowing up. They literally don\u2019t have the tools necessary to know they are taking on risks that are going to perform worse than average.\nYou can resolve this problem if you have a systematic way to identify riskier business. By rank ordering policies 1-10, with 1 being the best performing and 10 the worst performing policies, we see how this plays out. If a carrier writes a lot of business in the 8-10 range AND they get enough rate, or price, to cover the high likelihood of losses \u2013 they will do okay. But, what we see quite often is that carriers writing these policies apply rates appropriate for policies in the 4-6 range or 1-3 range.\nThat spells trouble.\nAnd this leads us to the second scenario we see happening more often, and that\u2019s when an insurer with more sophisticated strategies for pricing insurance policies knows more about the market and individual policies than the other competitors. Insurers who leverage advanced data are able to steal business at impressive profit margins. They get very aggressive on pricing insurance policies with the best performance, know how to get an adequate price for the riskier business, and have the confidence to walk away and let other carriers take on poor risks at inadequate prices.\nWith this backdrop, that\u2019s why we stress that you must have complete confidence in how you price insurance policies. Because if you don\u2019t, you are running a risky underwriting operation. Today\u2019s competitors are just too savvy. We worked with a regional insurer who discovered they were vulnerable to the competition \u2013 to the tune of over 12 loss ratio points.

When given the chance to adapt to new technologies, the leadership team was hesitant, choosing tradition over advancement. The insurance carrier withered as other technology-savvy competitors stealthily consumed the majority market share. Presumably as an expert at managing others\u2019 risk, Analog never thought to manage its own until it was too late. Analog is survived by a handful of underwriters and agents who hung on until the end, as well as visionless executives who are now looking for a job\u2026\nWhile a bit tongue-in-cheek, it is absolutely true that a bleak future is on the horizon for carriers who are not actively innovating and embracing the need for new technologies. The old adage, \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\u201d is alive and well in today\u2019s insurance market. Carriers should take a hard look at the late 1980s and 1990s when the credit card industry faced a similar crossroad. Information technology powerhouse Capitol One revolutionized the credit card industry with its innovative use of credit scores, identifying consumer spending patterns to find the best risks within the subprime market. Similarly, Progressive Insurance used analytics to lead the auto insurance market in the 90s by using credit scores to insure high risk drivers at profitable rates. Those who didn\u2019t use analytics suffered from adverse selection, ending up with poorer performing risks because they are working with outdated pricing and risk assessment strategies. And now, 80 percent of the personal auto market is controlled by just 10 companies.\nWork comp carriers can no longer garner profitable market share by simply raising rates and managing risks based on a single set of in-house company data. Many analysts agree that the best thing carriers can do to improve their combined ratio and ensure profitability is to achieve superior underwriting. According to a survey conducted by insurance consulting firm The Nolan Company, 78 percent of insurance executive respondents have cited \u201cinvesting in analytics\u201d as their top priority in underwriting. Ernst and Young recently called out workers\u2019 compensation as showing promising signs of driving underwriting profits and the leading companies who are leveraging advanced data and analytics to get there.\nIt\u2019s not an issue of underwriter incapability, but rather how to properly allocate their time to target the correct group of at-risk policies and the necessary speed with which they need to receive the most accurate information. For work comp underwriters, predictive analytics is a powerful tool they use to make superior risk and pricing decisions. Those companies who prioritize using innovative technologies and analytics create positive selection for their book of business and win profitable market share.\nAs more carriers turn to the power of analytical tools, innovation has quickly evolved into a necessity. A recent report by Celent titled, \u201cIT Spending in Insurance: A Global perspective\u201d found that insurance IT spending across the globe will increase from $162.1 billion to $176.7 billion by 2016. Along those same lines, Gartner research found that investments in analytic applications and advanced analytics totaled $14.4 billion in 2013, up 8 percent from 2012 ($13.3 billion). Dan Sommer, research director at Gartner, noted the analytics market is on the cusp of a series of tipping points \u201cwhich will facilitate unprecedented interest and adoption of analytics.\u201d The pressure is heightened even further with technology and e-commerce giants (who already have a solid understanding and access to data), such as Google, Facebook, and most recently Overstock, turning their attention to insurance.\nAs insurance becomes increasingly more data-driven, the competition for market share increases as well. If insurance follows the same path as the credit card industry, companies who adapt to new technologies will emerge as market leaders, while others run the risk of dying out from adverse selection.

We talk with carriers all the time who are trying to optimize their audit departments in different ways. Some approaches work well and others fall quite short.\nWhen we spoke with a particular regional carrier and found out how they were trying to fix their misclassification problems, we realized their approach was missing the mark. Their intuition was correct that they had significantly higher risk exposure on particular policies, and they were trying to do the right thing in order to improve their loss ratio. But, they didn\u2019t have a great process to find those policies and attack the problem. Because they didn\u2019t have the resources necessary to physically audit every policy, they had to focus on a subset. There were people running around using what we call \u201cblunt force\u201d business rules and creating multiple lists to rank order policies to audit. It was an inconsistent strategy at best \u2014 and a far cry from what they needed to get the job done.\nBy creating a common definition (i.e. baseline), they were able to determine the best approach rank ordering their policies and fixing their audit program.\nAnd it worked.\nTo the tune of $1 million dollars in immediate bottom line savings and a 3% drop in their loss ratio.\nIn another example, a state carrier was motivated to get their premium levels as close to 100% accurate as possible \u2013 whether that meant they found additional or return premium. It\u2019s really important for a state fund to look at poor performing policies, especially if they are a carrier of last resort \u2013 which means they are required to take on policies that private carriers refuse to write. They have to make sure their pricing is adequately covering the exposure they are taking on.\nAgain using a baseline approach, this carrier was able to better identify polices that needed to audited (or not) and improve the accuracy of their premium levels. By leveraging advanced data and analytics, they realized a 3-to-1 improvement in the results they achieved through their auditing activities. Regardless of whether they found returned premium or additional premium, they were able to find $3.02 more for every audit dollar spent versus using traditional business rules alone. That is a pretty massive improvement in cost efficiency.\nPUNCH LIST: Download 4 Steps to fix payroll misclassification on your book\n\u00a0\n ", "title": "1 Thing Carriers Forget in Preventing Fraud That Can Save Millions", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.14874686716791982, "subjectivity": 0.5623015873015874}, "500m-work-comp-fraud-new-york-tip-iceberg": {"content": "\nWe\u2019ve all taken notice since the New York grand jury released their report showing that New York City\u2019s construction industry cost the city and state approximately $500 million in 2011. The main reason for this staggering loss was unpaid workers\u2019 compensation premiums, in which businesses paid salaries off the books or purposely misclassified employees as independent contractors.\nThe situation in New York focused on workers\u2019 compensation in construction, but premium misclassification (which includes committing premium fraud) extends well beyond the borders of New York.\nPremium Misclassification \u2013 How Fraud Hurts Carriers\nFraud, or what some refer to as \u201cmoral hazard,\u201d is one cause of payroll misclassification for which carriers ultimately pay the price. When employers misrepresent the type of work an employee performs or falsely classifies employees as independent contractors, it creates meaningful revenue and expense implications for carriers reliant on self-reporting.\nThe NY grand jury specifically recommended a vigorous auditing program to catch bad actors. Interestingly, we have found large company insureds (e.g., large construction firms) tend to have less exposure-to-misclassification because they understand they will be physically audited more frequently. As such, carriers with sophisticated processes for identifying which policyholders to audit as part of their standard business practice will do a better job at catching premium fraud. That\u2019s the good news.\nThe bad news is that many carriers tend to focus their audit policies on polices above certain premium levels. By doing so, they a) expend significant energy (and cost) auditing policies that turn out to be in compliance and b) they miss the larger (but more fragmented) occurrence of misclassification which exists \u2018below the waterline.\u2019\n\u00a0\nWATCH:\u00a0How two carriers are saving millions by identifying payroll misclassification proactively\n\u00a0\nDOWNLOAD: 4\u00a0Steps to fix payroll misclassification on your book\n\n ", "title": "$500M Work Comp fraud in New York is Tip of the Iceberg", "author": "\nBy Kirstin Marr\n", "polarity": 0.1532374768089054, "subjectivity": 0.5056555349412492}, "valen-promotes-insurance-careers-nations-top-business-leaders": {"content": "\nLast week, I wrote an article for Change the Equation, the nation\u2019s premier organization that brings together top CEOs to connect the dots between the workforce pipeline and education \u2013 specifically STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math).

You can read the article below.\nPoint of View: Dax Craig\nOriginally published in the Change the Equation NOW Newsletter, April 15, 2014\nIndustries are now littered with examples of market leading companies that suffered or went under because they ignored new ways of thinking and innovative technology. Blockbuster comes to mind as a recent casualty. What companies like Netflix, Google, and Capital One did to change their industries so fundamentally was actually quite simple. They let data rule and, as a result, looked at their market much differently than the \u201ctried and true\u201d approaches of the past. Being analytically-driven was the catalyst that allowed these companies to upend the competitive landscape in their respective industries and come out on top.\nThe really interesting trend in these examples is the makeup of the people who drove this change. Young, bright minds proficient in math and science have had an enormous impact on the way we live our lives today. As a matter of fact, we see this trend of evolving business models playing out in our industry right now. Valen Analytics serves the insurance industry with advanced data and analytics that allow insurers to better match an individual policy risk with the right coverage and premium amount. Analytics has already changed the game in personal auto insurance with the likes of Progressive and GEICO, and now it\u2019s taking hold in other types of insurance.\nInsurance carriers are facing a threat to their traditional business models where investment income was the primary means of creating shareholder value. The current investment environment is driving a sea change and companies must now yield substantially more profit from their underwriting operations. The problem for the insurance industry is two-fold. First, while all industries face an aging workforce, insurance is being hit harder than most. In fact, 50 percent of the current workforce will retire in the next 15 years. There are hundreds of thousands of positions that need to be filled, and with half the labor force being made up by Millennials during this same time frame, it\u2019s clear the industry will need to recruit from the younger generations. However, the insurance industry isn\u2019t currently positioned very well to attract young, bright analytical talent. And that\u2019s what brought Valen to Change the Equation.\nWorking with Change the Equation, we started an initiative called Tomorrow\u2019s Talent Challenge. It\u2019s a way to coalesce an industry response on two fronts: a) making sure the next generation of talent is aware of the opportunity to bring innovative thinking to insurance and b) to give the industry a seat at the table as business leaders proactively influence our educational system to produce the future workforce pipeline we need. Even though we\u2019ve just begun, the response has been phenomenal. Many insurance carriers, like Change the Equation member State Farm, are glad to see a way forward in solving a legitimate talent crisis. Change the Equation\u2019s leadership is unparalleled in being able to bring together the nation\u2019s business leaders to drive meaningful and scalable change in STEM learning.

With half the industry nearing retirement, the brain trust of your organization is getting ready to walk out the door.

While new business automation has a firm footing in this commoditized world, is it enough in its current state to give small commercial carriers the edge they need to win? What about the value of human touch, collaboration and experience? As the industry\u2019s leading P&C web distribution platform provider, we at Agencyport think a lot about this kind of stuff, and we think there is an inevitable next evolutionary stage in small commercial automation\u2014one that is essential for profitability, and that is sitting on carriers\u2019 doorsteps right now.\nDownward pricing pressure, fierce competition and the need to increase margin have both carriers and agents struggling to make a living in small commercial. While the introduction of automation to this arena has improved speed, accuracy and efficiencies, market pressures are outpacing the current technologies. To win today, small commercial carriers have to make it utterly simple and highly effective (read: profitable) for their agent partners to do business with them. User experience is King. Carriers also have to bring as much data to bear on underwriting as possible\u2014data sourced both internally and externally.\nArguably, the greatest benefit of web automation for both carriers and agents in small commercial is speed\u2014quoting speed, binding speed, and speed-to-market with new products, product lines and geographies. Agents get faster, more complete responses from carriers and spend a fraction of the time rekeying; underwriters no longer have to touch straightforward applications, giving them valuable time to put their expertise to work on the complex ones; carriers and agents sell and renew more policies in less time; and customers and policyholders get the coverage and information they need faster and more accurately.\nBut profitability in today\u2019s small commercial space requires more than speed. It requires leveraging the latest, most open and agile distribution solutions available in order to:\n\nOptimize communication and transactions with agents and internal staff across all devices simply and beautifully\nEnable real time collaboration with agents\nSimplify and facilitate bi-directional integration with modern back office systems and the myriad specialized third-party providers that carriers need in to order to sell the most competitive products to exactly the right audiences simply, easily and with as little risk as possible.\n\nAgencyport\u2019s partnership with Valen is a natural outgrowth of both companies\u2019 understanding that those carriers that integrate specialized vendor solutions with their proprietary enterprise platforms produce more effective and robust products more quickly, efficiently and accurately, reducing risk and ensuring that agent partners and policyholders continue to come back for more. Does integration with these services preclude or threaten valuable agent/carrier relationships? Not at all. In fact, it bolsters them.

Of course, these kinds of prognostications don\u2019t sneak up on anyone. A convergence of growing organizational eagerness and sophisticated tools is allowing momentum to build for the next generation of underwriting to emerge. Read the report\nMarket dynamics are always an important factor in what ultimately makes the cut from strategic planning to implementation. The investment environment, increasing regulatory pressure and rising costs are influencing a more analytical approach to underwriting in order to increase profitability. With its historically volatile performance, homeowners insurance will be a particular focus in personal lines this year, as carriers adopt new approaches to drive profitability through underwriting.\nWhat homeowners carriers are focused on now is looking more closely at their non-catastrophe risks.According to an Insurance Journal study, only 39 percent of total homeowners losses were catastrophe-related. The lion\u2019s share of losses, at 61 percent, are non-cat related. The question then becomes: Are carriers spending enough time and resources developing underwriting strategies for their non-cat losses? As an example, Valen breaks down risks as mitigatable versus non-mitigatable as a way to help carriers reduce losses within their control. This shift to addressing losses based on a carrier\u2019s ability to affect the outcome and drive down loss ratio, will grow in 2014.\n2014 will provide a focus on shoring up the foundation needed to enable insurers of all shapes and sizes to become more analytically-driven. And while carriers make progress, securing the necessary talent needed to succeed is a growing and industry-wide concern.\nCheck out Valen\u2019s 2014 Outlook Report for Personal Lines for additional insights to help improve your underwriting performance.\n ", "title": "2014 Outlook: Personal Lines", "author": "\nBy Dax Craig\n", "polarity": 0.09485329485329486, "subjectivity": 0.557888407888408}, "550-commercial-underwriters-cant-wrong": {"content": "\nAccenture recently surveyed over 550 commercial lines underwriters, and a couple key stats jumped out:\n\n72 percent said that maintaining underwriting and pricing discipline was a top challenge.\n50 percent need more access to intuitive tools that can place information at their fingertips the moment a decision needs to be made.\n\nAccenture rightly points out that the use of predictive models for pricing and risk evaluation, along with increasing the use of external data, will become even bigger market differentiators as carriers invest significantly to take the next leap forward. We see the beginnings of that happening today in worker\u2019s compensation.\nWe pulled the latest stats from A.M. Best and noticed that workers\u2019 compensation is on the verge of mirroring personal lines from an overall performance perspective. As workers\u2019 compensation continues to improve with the adoption of new tools and analytics, market share consolidation \u2013 due to increasingly sophisticated pricing strategies amongst carriers \u2013 is a trend to monitor in 2014.\nThe latest A.M. Best data reveals that 56 percent of the workers\u2019 compensation market is performing better than the industry average combined ratio of 110.4. That number is comprised of 122 carriers, 11 of which are recognized as the \u201ctop 20\u201d workers\u2019 compensation carriers based on direct written premium. A deeper dive shows that 12 percent of the market\u2013 representing just a small handful of companies \u2013 is only .1 to .6 percent away from performing better than average. If these companies improve their performance even slightly, the percentage of workers\u2019 compensation carriers performing better than average increases from 56 to 68 percent. This aligns closely with the 69 percent of personal lines carriers that perform better than average in both auto and homeowners.\nSo the question becomes \u2013 are you above or below the line on this graph? If you are below the line, how will you support your underwriters so you can maintain your market position? If you are above the line, you are in a shrinking part of the market and your underwriters need better tools to grab profitable market share.
